  content: `# ⚔️ The Expedition of Tabuk — غَزْوَةُ تَبُوك

## Introduction

> "Allah has already forgiven the Prophet and the Emigrants and the Helpers who followed him in the hour of difficulty."
> 
> — **Surah At-Tawba (9:117)**

The Expedition of Tabuk (Rajab 9 AH / October 630 CE) was the **last major military expedition** of the Prophet ﷺ. It was the supreme test of faith, revealing the sincerity of believers and the hypocrisy of the false. This is why Surah At-Tawba, revealed on this occasion, is called **"al-Fāḍiḥa"** (The Exposer) or **"al-Kāshifa"** (The Revealer).

Imam Ibn al-Qayyim said in *Zād al-Ma'ād*: "Tabuk was the most difficult expedition: intense heat, ripe harvests, immense distance, powerful enemy. It was the crucible where pure gold was separated from base metal."

## 📍 Historical Context

### 1.1 The Geopolitical Situation

In the 9th year of Hijra, Islam had spread throughout Arabia. But to the north, the Byzantine Empire (الرُّوم) represented an **existential threat**:

| Empire | Leader | Religion | Army | Attitude |
|--------|--------|----------|------|----------|
| **Byzantine** | Heraclius | Christian | 200,000+ | Growing hostility |
| **Ghassanids** | Jabalah | Arab Christians | 40,000 | Vassals of Byzantium |
| **Islamic State** | Muhammad ﷺ | Islam | ~30,000 | Preemptive defense |

### 1.2 Rumors of Invasion

Nabataean merchants reported that:
- Heraclius was massing troops at the border
- Ghassanid tribes were preparing for war
- The goal was to **crush Islam** before it grew further

The Prophet ﷺ decided to take the initiative rather than await invasion.

## 🌡️ The Exceptional Difficulties

### 2.1 The Hour of Difficulty (سَاعَة العُسْرَة)

Allah calls this expedition **"the hour of difficulty"** (Surah 9:117). Here's why:

| Difficulty | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Extreme heat** | Month of Rajab, Arabian summer (~45-50°C / 113-122°F) |
| **Immense distance** | ~700 km from Medina to Tabuk (one way) |
| **Ripe harvests** | Date season, people wanted to stay |
| **Powerful enemy** | Confronting Rome, the world superpower |
| **Lack of resources** | Few mounts, little provisions |

### 2.2 The Army of Difficulty (جَيش العُسْرَة)

This army was nicknamed **Jaysh al-'Usra** (The Army of Difficulty):

**Hadith**:
> "Whoever equips the Army of Difficulty, Paradise is guaranteed for him."
> 
> — **Sahih al-Bukhari (2778)**

The Prophet ﷺ called for general mobilization. This time, unlike other expeditions, **he clearly announced the destination** so people could prepare.

---

## 💰 The Heroic Donations

### 3.1 'Uthman ibn 'Affan (may Allah be pleased with him)

'Uthman gave an **unprecedented** contribution:

> "'Uthman equipped the Army of Difficulty with 300 fully-loaded camels and 1,000 dinars. The Prophet ﷺ kept turning the dinars in his hand saying: 'Nothing will harm 'Uthman after what he has done today.' He repeated this several times."
> 
> — **Jami' at-Tirmidhi (3701), Hasan**

Some narrations mention he donated a total of **950 camels** and **50 horses**, plus the money.

### 3.2 Abu Bakr as-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him)

Abu Bakr brought **all his wealth**:

> "The Messenger of Allah ﷺ ordered us to give charity. At the time, I had some wealth. I said to myself: 'Today I will surpass Abu Bakr if ever I am to surpass him!' I brought half my wealth. The Prophet ﷺ asked me: 'What have you left for your family?' I said: 'The same amount.' Then Abu Bakr came with everything he owned. The Prophet ﷺ asked him: 'What have you left for your family?' He said: 'I left them Allah and His Messenger.' I then said: 'I will never surpass him in anything.'"
> 
> — **Sunan Abi Dawud (1678), Sahih**

### 3.3 'Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him)

'Umar brought **half his wealth**, thinking he would finally surpass Abu Bakr — but he was outdone (see hadith above).

### 3.4 The Weeping Poor

Among the most moving scenes, poor companions came begging the Prophet ﷺ to take them. Having no mounts for them, he could not. They left **weeping**:

> "Nor [is there blame] upon those who, when they came to you that you might give them mounts, you said: 'I find no mounts for you.' They turned back while their eyes overflowed with tears from grief that they could not find anything to spend."
> 
> — **Surah At-Tawba (9:92)**

These companions are known as the **"البَكَّائين" (al-Bakkā'ūn)** — those who wept.

## 📜 The Exposure of the Hypocrites

### 4.1 The Fallacious Excuses

Tabuk was the **supreme revealer** of hypocrisy. Many hypocrites invented excuses:

**Typical excuses**:
1. "It's too hot!" — Allah responded: "The fire of Hell is more intense." (9:81)
2. "Our harvests will rot!"
3. "Rome is too powerful!"
4. "Don't go out in this heat!"

### 4.2 Scathing Quranic Revelations

Allah revealed devastating verses:

> "Those who remained behind rejoiced at staying behind the Messenger of Allah and disliked to strive with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah and said: 'Do not go forth in the heat.' Say: 'The fire of Hell is more intense in heat' — if they would but understand."
> 
> — **Surah At-Tawba (9:81)**

### 4.3 The Mosque of Harm (Masjid ad-Dirar)

The pinnacle of hypocrisy was the construction of a **"mosque of harm"** (Masjid aḍ-Ḍirār) by the hypocrites to divide the community. Upon his return from Tabuk, the Prophet ﷺ received the divine order to **destroy it**:

> "And [there are] those who built a mosque to cause harm and disbelief and division among the believers... Never stand therein."
> 
> — **Surah At-Tawba (9:107-108)**

## 🗡️ The Course of the Expedition

### 5.1 The March to Tabuk

| **Forces** | ~30,000 fighters (the largest army) |
| **Duration** | ~20 days of marching |
| **Distance** | ~700 km |
| **Difficulties** | Thirst, hunger, heat, morale |

### 5.2 Miracles Along the Way

Despite the difficulties, **miracles** occurred:

**The lost camel**:
A hypocrite mocked: "Muhammad claims to know the unseen, but he doesn't know where his camel is!" The Prophet ﷺ replied:
> "By Allah, I know only what Allah teaches me. And He has informed me that the camel is in such valley, its halter caught on such tree."
> 
> They found it exactly as described.
> 
> — **Reported by Muslim (2772)**

### 5.3 Arrival at Tabuk — No Combat

Upon arrival, the Muslims discovered that the Byzantines had **retreated**. Heraclius, informed of the size of the Muslim army, had ordered withdrawal.

**Results**:
- No pitched battle
- Submission of several border tribes
- Treaties with the Christians of Ayla, Jarba, Adhruh
- Demonstration of the Islamic state's power

## 😢 The Three Boycotted Companions

### 6.1 The Story of Ka'b ibn Malik

The most famous story of Tabuk is that of the **three sincere companions** who stayed behind without valid excuse:

1. **Ka'b ibn Malik** (may Allah be pleased with him)
2. **Murāra ibn ar-Rabī'** (may Allah be pleased with him)
3. **Hilāl ibn Umayyah** (may Allah be pleased with him)

Ka'b narrates his own story in an extraordinarily long and moving hadith (Bukhari & Muslim).

### 6.2 Ka'b's Account

**Why he stayed**:
> "I had never been more prosperous or better equipped than at that time. I had two mounts! I kept saying each day: 'I'll leave tomorrow.' Until the army left and I remained."

**His sincerity before the Prophet**:
When hypocrites invented excuses, Ka'b refused to lie:
> "O Messenger of Allah! By Allah, if I were sitting before anyone else in the world, I would try to escape his anger with an excuse. I am eloquent. But I know that if I lie to you today to please you, Allah will soon reveal the truth and you will be angry. And if I tell you the truth and you become angry, I hope for Allah's pardon. By Allah, I had no excuse. I was in perfect health when I stayed behind."

The Prophet ﷺ said: "This one has spoken the truth. Stand aside until Allah decides your case."

### 6.3 The 50-Day Boycott

Allah ordered the Muslims to **boycott** the three:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Duration** | 50 days |
| **Prohibitions** | No one spoke to them or greeted them |
| **Even spouses** | Ordered to separate from them (without divorce) |
| **Maximum trial** | Ka'b received a letter from the Ghassanid king inviting him to join — he burned it |

### 6.4 The Repentance Accepted

After 50 days of anguish, Allah revealed their pardon:

> "And [He also forgave] the three who were left behind [and regretted their error] to the point that the earth became strait for them despite its vastness, and their souls became strait within them. And they perceived that there is no refuge from Allah except in Him. Then He turned to them that they might repent. Indeed, Allah is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful."
> 
> — **Surah At-Tawba (9:118)**

Ka'b describes that moment:
> "When I heard the voice of the announcer from Mount Sal' calling: 'O Ka'b ibn Malik! Rejoice!' I fell into prostration. I knew relief had come. The Prophet ﷺ said with his face shining with joy: 'Rejoice with the best day that has passed over you since your mother gave birth to you!' I offered all my wealth as charity, but he advised me to keep some."
> 
> — **Sahih al-Bukhari (4418) and Muslim (2769)**

## 📚 The Eternal Lessons of Tabuk

### 7.1 Sincerity (الإخلاص)

| Category | Behavior | Consequence |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Hypocrites** | False excuses | Exposed and humiliated |
| **Ka'b and companions** | Painful truth | Divine pardon and eternal honor |
| **Abu Bakr** | Total giving | "I will never surpass him" ('Umar) |

**Lesson**: Sincerity, even painful, is always rewarded. Lying, even comfortable, leads to ruin.

### 7.2 Sacrifice for Allah

The companions sacrificed:
- Their wealth (entire fortunes)
- Their comfort (extreme heat)
- Their safety (confronting Rome)
- Their harvests (date season)

**Key hadith**:
> "Whoever equips a fighter in the cause of Allah, it is as if he himself fought."
> 
> — **Sahih al-Bukhari (2843) and Muslim (1895)**

### 7.3 The Importance of Truth

Ka'b said:
> "By Allah, I do not know that Allah has bestowed upon anyone, for speaking the truth, a better reward than He bestowed upon me. Since the day I told the truth to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, I have never intended to lie. And I hope Allah will protect me for the rest of my life."

### 7.4 Repentance (التَّوْبَة)

Surah At-Tawba takes its name from this theme. Allah shows that:
- Sincere repentance is always accepted
- Trials purify
- The time of trial is limited, forgiveness is eternal

## 🏆 Remarkable Figures of Tabuk

### Abu Dharr al-Ghifari (may Allah be pleased with him)

His camel was too weak. He fell behind. Rather than give up, he walked on foot through the desert. When he appeared on the horizon, the Prophet ﷺ said:

> "Let it be Abu Dharr!" When he was recognized, he said: "May Allah have mercy on Abu Dharr! He walks alone, will die alone, and will be resurrected alone."
> 
> — **Reported by Ibn Hibban, Sahih**

### Abu Khaythama (may Allah be pleased with him)

He stayed behind a few days then, seized by remorse seeing his wives and shaded gardens, exclaimed: "The Messenger of Allah ﷺ is in the heat and wind, and I am in cool shade with beautiful women? This is not fair!" He set out alone to rejoin the army.

## 🤲 Du'a of Travel

During the march, the Prophet ﷺ would supplicate:

> 
> "O Allah! I seek refuge in You from the hardships of travel, the gloom of return, and misfortune in wealth, family, and children."
> 
> — **Sahih Muslim (1343)**
