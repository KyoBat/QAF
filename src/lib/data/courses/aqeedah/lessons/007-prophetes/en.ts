<div class="scene-box">

**🌊 950 Years of Calling: The Epic of Nuh عليه السلام**

*For almost a millennium, Nuh عليه السلام called his people. Day and night. In public and in private...*

*They mocked him. They put their fingers in their ears. They covered themselves with their garments...*

**The nobles:** *(laughing)* « Look at him! Building a ship in the desert! Has he gone mad? »

**Nuh:** *(calmly, continuing to build)* « If you ridicule us, then we will ridicule you just as you ridicule. »

*The years passed. 100 years. 300. 500. 800...*

*Finally, after **950 years**:*

> ﴿فَلَبِثَ فِيهِمْ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ إِلَّا خَمْسِينَ عَامًا﴾ [Al-'Ankabut: 14]

*The day of the flood, they understood. But it was too late.*

*The same message. 124,000 prophets. One mission: **La ilaha illa Allah**.*

**Yunus:** ﴿لَّا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا أَنتَ **سُبْحَانَكَ** إِنِّي كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ﴾

## 🛡️ Refuting Common Doubts

### First Doubt: "The prophets sinned like everyone else"

**❌ The Doubt:** Some say: "The prophets committed major sins!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Prophets are infallible in transmission:**
   They are protected from error in what they convey from Allah.

2. **Their mistakes are minor and forgiven:**
   > ﴿لِيَغْفِرَ لَكَ اللَّهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِن ذَنبِكَ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ﴾
   > "That Allah may forgive you your past and future sins." [Al-Fath: 2]

3. **They are the best of humanity:**
   If someone had major sins, they would not be chosen as a prophet.

4. **Imam Ibn Taymiyyah رحمه الله said:**
   > *"Prophets are preserved from major sins and from persisting in minor sins."*

---

### Second Doubt: "Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was a violent warrior"

**❌ The Doubt:** "Muhammad waged wars, so he was not a man of peace!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Jihad is prescribed for defense:**
   > ﴿أُذِنَ لِلَّذِينَ يُقَاتَلُونَ بِأَنَّهُمْ ظُلِمُوا﴾
   > "Permission has been given to those who are being fought because they were wronged." [Al-Hajj: 39]

2. **His wars were defensive:**
   The Quraysh fought him and expelled him from his homeland.

3. **His mercy was immense:**
   During the conquest of Mecca, he forgave all his enemies.

4. **The number of casualties was minimal:**
   In all his battles, about 1000 people died on both sides, over 23 years.

---

### Third Doubt: "Why did the Prophet have multiple wives?"

**❌ The Doubt:** "Why was the Prophet ﷺ allowed to have more than 4 wives?"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Legislative and social reasons:**
   - Caring for widows and orphans
   - Strengthening tribal bonds
   - Transmitting private Sunnah

2. **Most were widows:**
   Only 'Aisha رضي الله عنها was a virgin.

3. **Allah specifically permitted him:**
   > ﴿يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ إِنَّا أَحْلَلْنَا لَكَ﴾
   > "O Prophet, We have made lawful to you..." [Al-Ahzab: 50]

4. **His life was of extreme asceticism:**
   Despite his wives, he lived in poverty.

---

### Fourth Doubt: "Why don't prophets' miracles repeat?"

**❌ The Doubt:** "Miracles are myths because they don't repeat!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Miracles are signs for their time:**
   Each prophet had miracles suited to his era.

2. **The permanent miracle is the Quran:**
   > ﴿وَإِن كُنتُمْ فِي رَيْبٍ مِّمَّا نَزَّلْنَا عَلَىٰ عَبْدِنَا فَأْتُوا بِسُورَةٍ مِّن مِّثْلِهِ﴾
   > "If you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then bring a surah the like thereof." [Al-Baqarah: 23]

3. **Miracles are transmitted through tawatur:**
   They are reported through authentic chains of transmission.

---

### Fifth Doubt: "Jesus is more than a prophet"

**❌ The Doubt:** Some Christians say: "Jesus is the son of God, not just a prophet!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **'Issa عليه السلام himself denied this:**
   > ﴿مَا قُلْتُ لَهُمْ إِلَّا مَا أَمَرْتَنِي بِهِ أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ رَبِّي وَرَبَّكُمْ﴾
   > "I said not to them except what You commanded me: 'Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.'" [Al-Ma'idah: 117]

2. **Allah has no son:**
   > ﴿لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ﴾
   > "He neither begets nor is born." [Al-Ikhlas: 3]

3. **'Issa is an honored servant:**
   > ﴿إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ﴾
   > "He was but a servant upon whom We bestowed favor." [Az-Zukhruf: 59]
