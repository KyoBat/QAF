<div class="scene-box">

## 950 Years of Calling: The Patience of Nuh عليه السلام

The sun beat down on the worksite. Nuh عليه السلام, despite his advanced age, continued building the ark in the middle of a desert, far from any sea. The nobles of his people passed by and laughed:

> *"O Nuh! Have you become a carpenter now? Building a boat where there is no water!"*

Nuh would answer them calmly:

> **"If you ridicule us, then we will ridicule you just as you ridicule."** (Hud 11:38)

It had been **950 years** since he began calling his people day and night, in secret and in public. Most had refused. But Nuh never despaired of Allah's mercy...

The day of the flood, those who had mocked understood. But it was too late.

**What was this mission so important that Nuh and all prophets carried for centuries? Let us discover together the common message of these chosen ones of Allah.**

## 🔍 Definition

Belief in the prophets and messengers means having firm faith that Allah sent messengers to every community to guide them to Tawhid, that we must respect all of them without distinction, and that Muhammad ﷺ is the last of them.

## Proof of the obligation of this belief

Allah ﷻ says:

> "The Messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, and so have the believers. All of them have believed in Allah and His angels and His books and His messengers, saying: 'We make no distinction between any of His messengers.'" (Al-Baqara 2:285)

## 🔍 The Difference Between Nabi (Prophet) and Rasul (Messenger)

### Nabi (نبي) - Prophet

One who receives revelation from Allah and is commanded to convey it. He may be sent to a people who already believe, to remind them of the law of a previous Rasul.

### Rasul (رسول) - Messenger

One who is sent to a disbelieving or rebellious people with a legislation, whether new or confirming a previous one.

> *Source: Ibn Taymiyyah, Majmu' al-Fatawa, vol. 7, p. 281*

> "And We did not send any messenger except in the language of his people to make clear to them." (Ibrahim 14:4)

**Note**: Every messenger is a prophet, but not every prophet is necessarily a messenger.

---

## The Mission of the Prophets

### 1️⃣ Calling to Tawhid

> "And We sent not before you any messenger except that We revealed to him that: 'There is no deity except Me, so worship Me.'" (Al-Anbiya 21:25)

### 2️⃣ Giving glad tidings and warning

> "Messengers as bearers of good tidings and warners so that mankind will have no argument against Allah after the messengers." (An-Nisa 4:165)

### 3️⃣ Teaching and purifying

> "It is He who has sent among the unlettered a Messenger from themselves reciting to them His verses and purifying them and teaching them the Book and wisdom." (Al-Jumu'a 62:2)

   They are protected from error in what they convey from Allah.

   > ﴿لِيَغْفِرَ لَكَ اللَّهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِن ذَنبِكَ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ﴾
   > "That Allah may forgive you your past and future sins." [Al-Fath: 2]

3. **They are the best of humanity:**
   If someone had major sins, they would not be chosen as a prophet.

4. **Imam Ibn Taymiyyah رحمه الله said:**
   > *"Prophets are preserved from major sins and from persisting in minor sins."*

2. **Allah has no son:**
   > ﴿لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ﴾
   > "He neither begets nor is born." [Al-Ikhlas: 3]

   > ﴿إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ﴾
   > "He was but a servant upon whom We bestowed favor." [Az-Zukhruf: 59]

## 📜 Stories about the Prophets

### Ibrahim's عليه السلام Trial with Fire

<div class="scene-box">

When Ibrahim عليه السلام broke the idols, his people wanted to burn him alive.

<div class="scene-box">

When the Prophet ﷺ was chased from Ta'if, bloodied and wounded, the angel of the mountains offered to crush the city between two mountains.
