<div class="scene-box">

**🌙 The Night of the First Revelation**

*The cave of Hira. Complete darkness. Muhammad ﷺ in deep meditation...*

*Suddenly—a presence. Overwhelming. Powerful.*

*The angel Jibril appears:*

**Jibril:** « **اقْرَأْ** — READ! »

**Muhammad ﷺ:** *(trembling)* « I cannot read... »

*Jibril embraces him tightly—so tight he can barely breathe—then releases him:*

**Jibril:** « **READ!** »

**Muhammad ﷺ:** « I cannot read... »

*A third embrace, even tighter. Then:*

**Jibril:** « **Read, in the name of your Lord who created. Created man from a clinging substance. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous.** »

*(Al-'Alaq: 1-3)*

*That blessed night of Ramadan... the first words of the **Quran** descended upon earth.*

*The final Book. The eternal guidance. Protected until the end of time.*

</div>

> Belief in the Books is the **third pillar** of the six pillars of faith.

## 🔷 The Quran: The Final Book

### Five Unique Characteristics

| Characteristic | Proof |
|----------------|-------|
| **Final** | ﴿مَّا كَانَ مُحَمَّدٌ أَبَا أَحَدٍ مِّن رِّجَالِكُمْ وَلَٰكِن رَّسُولَ اللَّهِ وَ**خَاتَمَ النَّبِيِّينَ**﴾ |
| **Preserved** | ﴿إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا الذِّكْرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ **لَحَافِظُونَ**﴾ |
| **Confirming** | ﴿مُصَدِّقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ﴾ |
| **Abrogating** | ﴿وَ**مُهَيْمِنًا** عَلَيْهِ﴾ (criterion over previous books) |
| **Inimitable** | ﴿فَأْتُوا بِسُورَةٍ مِّن مِّثْلِهِ﴾ — never achieved |

## 📜 The Compilation of the Quran

### Phase 1: Under Abu Bakr رضي الله عنه

<div class="scene-box">

**📖 After the Battle of Yamama**

*Many memorizers (huffaz) had been martyred. 'Umar rushes to Abu Bakr:*

**'Umar:** « I fear for the Quran! Many huffaz have been killed. We must compile it! »

**Abu Bakr:** *(hesitant)* « How can I do something the Prophet ﷺ did not do? »

**'Umar:** *(insisting)* « By Allah, it is good! »

*Abu Bakr's heart opens. He summons Zayd ibn Thabit:*

**Abu Bakr:** « You are young, intelligent, and you used to write the revelation. **Compile the Quran.** »

**Zayd:** *(overwhelmed)* « By Allah! If they had asked me to move a mountain, it would have been easier than compiling the Quran! »

*But he did it. He gathered every written piece—from palm leaves, parchments, flat stones—and verified each verse with the memorizers.*

*(Sahih Al-Bukhari 4986)*

</div>

### Phase 2: Under 'Uthman رضي الله عنه

<div class="scene-box">

**📖 Unifying the Ummah**

*Disputes arose. People from different regions reciting differently...*

**Hudhayfa ibn al-Yaman:** *(returning from conquests)* « O Commander of the Believers! **Save this Ummah** before they differ about the Book like the Jews and Christians! »

*'Uthman acts. He orders copies made from Abu Bakr's manuscript. He sends them to every region.*

**'Uthman:** « **I have united the people on a single Mushaf.** »

*All other copies burned. One Quran. One Ummah. Forever.*

</div>

### Types of Falsification

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Tahrif al-Lafz** | Changing the words |

## 🛡️ Refutation of Doubts (الشُّبُهات والرد عليها)

### First Doubt: "The Quran contains contradictions"

**❌ The Doubt:** Some say: "There are contradictory verses in the Quran!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Allah has challenged those who claim this:**
   > ﴿أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْآنَ ۚ وَلَوْ كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ غَيْرِ اللَّهِ لَوَجَدُوا فِيهِ اخْتِلَافًا كَثِيرًا﴾
   > "Do they not reflect upon the Quran? If it had been from other than Allah, they would have found within it much contradiction." [An-Nisa: 82]

2. **What they think is a contradiction is:**
   - Either an abrogation (Naskh) intended by Allah
   - Or an apparent contradiction resolved by scholars
   - Or a lack of understanding of context

3. **Thousands of scholars have studied the Quran:**
   No real contradiction has been found in 1400 years.

---

### Second Doubt: "The Quran has been altered like other Books"

**❌ The Doubt:** "How do you know the Quran hasn't been altered too?"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **The divine promise:**
   > ﴿إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا الذِّكْرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَافِظُونَ﴾
   > "Indeed, it is We who sent down the Reminder, and indeed, We will be its guardian." [Al-Hijr: 9]

2. **Uninterrupted transmission (Tawatur):**
   - Memorized by millions of people in every generation
   - Written during the Prophet's ﷺ time
   - Compiled under Abu Bakr then standardized under 'Uthman رضي الله عنهم

3. **Ancient manuscripts:**
   The oldest manuscripts correspond exactly to the current Quran.

---

### Third Doubt: "The Bible is also preserved"

**❌ The Doubt:** "We also say our Book is preserved!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **No divine promise of preservation:**
   Unlike the Quran, there is no divine promise to preserve the Torah or Gospel.

2. **Historical evidence:**
   - Multiple contradictory versions
   - Documented additions and deletions
   - No authentic chain of transmission

3. **The Quran itself testifies:**
   > ﴿فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ يَكْتُبُونَ الْكِتَابَ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ﴾
   > "Woe to those who write the Book with their own hands." [Al-Baqarah: 79]

---

### Fourth Doubt: "The Quran is not a scientific miracle"

**❌ The Doubt:** "The scientific miracles of the Quran are exaggerated!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **The Quran is not a book of science, but of guidance:**
   Its main miracle is linguistic and legislative.

2. **However, it does not contradict any scientific truth:**
   What is scientifically confirmed never contradicts the Quran.

3. **The challenge remains:**
   > ﴿فَأْتُوا بِسُورَةٍ مِّن مِّثْلِهِ﴾
   > "Then bring a surah the like thereof." [Al-Baqarah: 23]

---

### Fifth Doubt: "Why is the Quran in Arabic only?"

**❌ The Doubt:** "If the Quran is universal, why wasn't it revealed in multiple languages?"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Every prophet was sent in the language of his people:**
   > ﴿وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا بِلِسَانِ قَوْمِهِ﴾
   > "We have not sent any Messenger except in the language of his people." [Ibrahim: 4]

2. **Arabic is the richest language:**
   It preserves nuances and precise meanings.

3. **Translation is possible:**
   The meanings are translated into all languages.
