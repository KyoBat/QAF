## Proof of the obligation of this belief

## The Quran: The Final Book

### Its revelation

> "The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for the people." (Al-Baqara 2:185)

### Its unique characteristics

1. **Last revelation**: No book will be revealed after it
   > "Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and last of the prophets." (Al-Ahzab 33:40)

2. **Confirmation of previous Books**
   > "And We have revealed to you the Book in truth, confirming that which preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it." (Al-Ma'ida 5:48)

3. **Abrogation of previous legislations**: The rulings of the Quran abrogate those of previous Books

## The Falsification of Previous Books

The Books revealed before the Quran were falsified by their peoples:

> "Among the Jews are those who distort words from their usages." (An-Nisa 4:46)

> "So woe to those who write the 'scripture' with their own hands, then say: 'This is from Allah,' in order to exchange it for a small price." (Al-Baqara 2:79)

3. **Kitman** (كتمان): Concealing parts of revelation

## Our Attitude Towards Previous Books

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> "Do not believe the People of the Book, nor disbelieve them. Rather say: 'We believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us.'" (Sahih Al-Bukhari 4485)

### What we must do:

1. **Believe** that they were originally the word of Allah
2. **Acknowledge** that they have been falsified
3. **Not read them** for guidance (the Quran suffices)
4. **Follow the Quran** as the sole legislative reference

---

## The Virtues of the Quran

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> "The best among you is the one who learns the Quran and teaches it." (Sahih Al-Bukhari 5027)

> "Read the Quran, for it will come on the Day of Resurrection as an intercessor for its companions." (Sahih Muslim 804)

> "Whoever recites a letter from the Book of Allah will have a good deed, and the good deed is rewarded tenfold." (Tirmidhi 2910)

## The Effects of Believing in the Books

1. **Gratitude to Allah**: For guiding humanity through His revelations
2. **Attachment to the Quran**: As the only preserved and valid Book today
3. **Understanding Allah's mercy**: Who has never left humanity without guidance
4. **Rejection of superstitions**: By relying only on authentic revelation

## 🛡️ Refutation of Doubts (الشُّبُهات والرد عليها)

### First Doubt: "The Quran contains contradictions"

**❌ The Doubt:** Some say: "There are contradictory verses in the Quran!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Allah has challenged those who claim this:**
   > ﴿أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْآنَ ۚ وَلَوْ كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ غَيْرِ اللَّهِ لَوَجَدُوا فِيهِ اخْتِلَافًا كَثِيرًا﴾
   > "Do they not reflect upon the Quran? If it had been from other than Allah, they would have found within it much contradiction." [An-Nisa: 82]

2. **What they think is a contradiction is:**
   - Either an abrogation (Naskh) intended by Allah
   - Or an apparent contradiction resolved by scholars
   - Or a lack of understanding of context

3. **Thousands of scholars have studied the Quran:**
   No real contradiction has been found in 1400 years.

---

### Second Doubt: "The Quran has been altered like other Books"

**❌ The Doubt:** "How do you know the Quran hasn't been altered too?"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **The divine promise:**
   > ﴿إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا الذِّكْرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَافِظُونَ﴾
   > "Indeed, it is We who sent down the Reminder, and indeed, We will be its guardian." [Al-Hijr: 9]

2. **Uninterrupted transmission (Tawatur):**
   - Memorized by millions of people in every generation
   - Written during the Prophet's ﷺ time
   - Compiled under Abu Bakr then standardized under 'Uthman رضي الله عنهم

3. **Ancient manuscripts:**
   The oldest manuscripts correspond exactly to the current Quran.

---

### Third Doubt: "The Bible is also preserved"

**❌ The Doubt:** "We also say our Book is preserved!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **No divine promise of preservation:**
   Unlike the Quran, there is no divine promise to preserve the Torah or Gospel.

2. **Historical evidence:**
   - Multiple contradictory versions
   - Documented additions and deletions
   - No authentic chain of transmission

3. **The Quran itself testifies:**
   > ﴿فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ يَكْتُبُونَ الْكِتَابَ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ﴾
   > "Woe to those who write the Book with their own hands." [Al-Baqarah: 79]

---

### Fourth Doubt: "The Quran is not a scientific miracle"

**❌ The Doubt:** "The scientific miracles of the Quran are exaggerated!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **The Quran is not a book of science, but of guidance:**
   Its main miracle is linguistic and legislative.

2. **However, it does not contradict any scientific truth:**
   What is scientifically confirmed never contradicts the Quran.

3. **The challenge remains:**
   > ﴿فَأْتُوا بِسُورَةٍ مِّن مِّثْلِهِ﴾
   > "Then bring a surah the like thereof." [Al-Baqarah: 23]

---

### Fifth Doubt: "Why is the Quran in Arabic only?"

**❌ The Doubt:** "If the Quran is universal, why wasn't it revealed in multiple languages?"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Every prophet was sent in the language of his people:**
   > ﴿وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا بِلِسَانِ قَوْمِهِ﴾
   > "We have not sent any Messenger except in the language of his people." [Ibrahim: 4]

2. **Arabic is the richest language:**
   It preserves nuances and precise meanings.

3. **Translation is possible:**
   The meanings are translated into all languages.
