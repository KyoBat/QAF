## Introduction

The Islamic creed is distinguished by unique characteristics that make it the true creed that Allah has chosen for His servants. These characteristics prove that it comes from Allah, the All-Knowing, the Wise.

Allah ﷻ says:

> "Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam." (Al Imran 3:19)

---

## First: Divine Source

### Meaning

The Islamic creed has its source in revelation from Allah, not from human efforts or their philosophies.

### Proofs

> "Nor does he speak from his own desire. It is not but a revelation revealed." (An-Najm 53:3-4)

> "A revelation from the Most Merciful, the Most Gracious." (Fussilat 41:2)

### Fruits of this

1. **Preservation from error**: Because it comes from the All-Knowing, the Wise
2. **Perfection**: Because Allah is perfect, without defect
3. **Stability**: It does not change with time and place
4. **Decisive proof**: Because it comes from the Creator, not from the creation

---

## Second: Clarity and Evidence

### Meaning

The Islamic creed is clear, without ambiguity, understood by both the scholar and the common person.

### Proofs

> "A Book whose verses are perfected and then presented in detail from One who is Wise and Acquainted." (Hud 11:1)

> "And We have certainly made the Quran easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember?" (Al-Qamar 54:17)

### Examples of clarity

- **Tawhid**: ﴿Say: "He is Allah, the One"﴾ — Clear to everyone
- **Pillars of faith**: Six well-defined pillars
- **The lawful and unlawful**: Clear, without confusion

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **"I have left you upon a clear path, its night is like its day. No one deviates from it after me except that he is destroyed."**
> (Sahih Ibn Majah, authenticated by Al-Albani)

---

## Third: Conformity to the Innate Nature (Fitra)

### Meaning

The Islamic creed is in accord with the sound nature upon which Allah created people.

### Proof

> "So direct your face toward the religion, inclining to truth. Adhere to the Fitra of Allah upon which He has created all people. No change should there be in the creation of Allah." (Ar-Rum 30:30)

### Examples

1. **Faith in the Creator**: Every human feels their need for a creator
2. **Tawhid**: The sound nature repels polytheism
3. **Modesty**: Part of the sound nature
4. **Love of good**: Embedded in souls

## Fourth: Conformity to Sound Reason

### Meaning

There is never any contradiction between authentic creed and sound reason.

### Proof

> "Then do they not reflect upon the Quran? If it had been from other than Allah, they would have found within it much contradiction." (An-Nisa 4:82)

### Important rule

Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah رحمه الله said:

> **"An authentic text never contradicts clear reason."**

If a contradiction seems to exist:
- Either the text is not authentic
- Or the reason is not clear (there is an ambiguity)

## Fifth: Comprehensiveness and Perfection

### Meaning

The Islamic creed encompasses everything the human being needs in their life and afterlife.

### Proof

> "This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion." (Al-Ma'ida 5:3)

### Areas of comprehensiveness

1. **Theology**: Knowledge of Allah, His Names and Attributes
2. **Prophetology**: Faith in prophets and books
3. **Eschatology**: Unseen matters like Angels and the Last Day
4. **Worship**: How to worship Allah
5. **Transactions**: Relations between people
6. **Ethics**: Values and behavior

## Sixth: Moderation and Balance

### Meaning

The Islamic creed is a middle ground between excess and negligence.

### Proof

> "And thus We have made you a just community that you will be witnesses over the people." (Al-Baqara 2:143)

### Examples of moderation

| Topic | Excess | Negligence | Middle ground (Islam) |
|-------|--------|------------|----------------------|
| Prophets | Deifying them (Christians) | Killing them (Jews) | Respecting and following them |
| Attributes | Likening | Negation | Affirmation without resemblance |
| Deeds | Relying on deeds | Abandoning deeds | Acting while trusting in Allah |
| Destiny | Fatalism | Denying destiny | Affirming destiny and free choice |

### What is stable

## Eighth: Balance between This World and the Hereafter

### Meaning

Neither monasticism that abandons this world, nor materialism that forgets the hereafter.

### Proof

> "But seek, through that which Allah has given you, the home of the Hereafter; and yet, do not forget your share of this world." (Al-Qasas 28:77)

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **"The best among you is not the one who abandons his worldly life for his hereafter, nor his hereafter for his worldly life, until he attains from both."**
> (Reported by Ibn 'Asakir)

---

## Ninth: Combining Fear and Hope

### Meaning

The believer fears Allah's punishment while hoping for His mercy, without letting one prevail over the other.

### Proofs

> "Inform My servants that it is I who am the Forgiving, the Merciful. And that it is My punishment which is the painful punishment." (Al-Hijr 15:49-50)

> "Those whom they invoke seek means of access to their Lord, striving as to which of them would be nearest, and they hope for His mercy and fear His punishment." (Al-Isra 17:57)

---

## Tenth: Liberation of the Mind and Man

### Meaning

The Islamic creed liberates man from servitude to other than Allah.

### Proof

> "Say: 'O People of the Scripture, come to a word that is equitable between us and you - that we will not worship except Allah and not associate anything with Him and not take one another as lords instead of Allah.'" (Al Imran 3:64)
