## 🔍 Definition

Belief in divine decree means having firm faith that Allah has predetermined everything, that He knows everything before its creation, that He has written it in the Preserved Tablet (Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz), that He has willed it, and that He has created it.

## Proof of the obligation of this belief

The Prophet ﷺ said in the famous hadith of Jibril:

> "Faith (iman) is to believe in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day, and to believe in divine decree (qadr), its good and its evil." (Sahih Muslim 8)

Allah ﷻ says:

> "Indeed, all things We created with predestination (qadr)." (Al-Qamar 54:49)

## The Four Levels of Divine Decree

### 1️⃣ Knowledge ('Ilm) - العِلم

Allah knows everything before it comes into existence.

> "And with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them except Him. And He knows what is on the land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls but that He knows it." (Al-An'am 6:59)

> "And nothing is hidden from Allah on the earth or in the heaven." (Ibrahim 14:38)

### 2️⃣ Writing (Kitaba) - الكتابة

Allah has written everything in the Preserved Tablet (Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz).

> "Do you not know that Allah knows what is in the heaven and earth? Indeed, that is in a Record. Indeed, that is easy for Allah." (Al-Hajj 22:70)

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> "Allah wrote the decrees of creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth." (Sahih Muslim 2653)

### 3️⃣ Will (Mashee'a) - المَشيئة

Nothing occurs except that Allah has willed it.

> "And you do not will except that Allah wills - Lord of the worlds." (At-Takwir 81:29)

> "That is the determination of the Exalted in Might, the Knowing." (Al-An'am 6:96)

### 4️⃣ Creation (Khalq) - الخَلق

Allah is the Creator of everything, including the actions of His servants.

> "Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is, over all things, Disposer of affairs." (Az-Zumar 39:62)

> "While Allah created you and that which you do." (As-Saffat 37:96)

## Types of Divine Decree

### 1️⃣ Universal Decree (Kawniyy)

What Allah decrees in His creation (life, death, illness, provision, etc.)

> "And if Allah should touch you with adversity, there is no remover of it except Him. And if He touches you with good - then He is over all things competent." (Al-An'am 6:17)

### 2️⃣ Legislative Decree (Shar'iyy)

What Allah commands or prohibits for His servants.

Obedience falls under what Allah loves and is pleased with.
Disobedience falls under what Allah hates, even if it occurs by His universal will.

---

## Man Between Destiny and Free Will

### Man has real will

> "For whoever wills among you to take a right course." (At-Takwir 81:28)

> "Indeed, We guided him to the way, be he grateful or be he ungrateful." (Al-Insan 76:3)

### This will is under Allah's Will

> "And you do not will except that Allah wills." (At-Takwir 81:29)

### Consequence

- Man is responsible for his actions because he truly chooses
- But nothing escapes Allah's Will and Knowledge

## What Belief in Divine Decree Requires

### 1️⃣ Submission to Allah

Accepting what happens to us with patience and contentment.

> "Say: 'Never will we be struck except by what Allah has decreed for us; He is our protector.' And upon Allah let the believers rely." (At-Tawba 9:51)

### 2️⃣ Action and effort

Belief in divine decree is not an excuse for inaction.

The Prophet ﷺ said:
> **«تَدَاوَوْا عِبَادَ اللَّهِ، فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَمْ يَضَعْ دَاءً إِلَّا وَضَعَ لَهُ شِفَاءً»**
> "Seek treatment, O servants of Allah, for Allah has not created a disease without creating its cure." (Abu Dawud 3855, authenticated by Al-Albani)

A man said to the Prophet ﷺ: "Should I let my camel loose and rely on Allah?"
He ﷺ replied:
> **«اعْقِلْهَا وَتَوَكَّلْ»**
> "Tie it, then rely on Allah." (Tirmidhi 2517, graded Hasan by Al-Albani)

### 3️⃣ Not arguing with destiny

We do not justify sins by destiny, for we have a choice.

---

## What is Prohibited Concerning Divine Decree

### 1️⃣ Jabrism (الجبرية)

Claiming that man has no choice and is completely compelled.

**Refutation**: Allah has affirmed that man has will and choices.

### 2️⃣ Qadarism (القدرية)

Claiming that man creates his own actions independently of Allah.

**Refutation**: "While Allah created you and that which you do." (As-Saffat 37:96)

---

## 🌟 The Benefits of Believing in Divine Decree

1. **Tranquility of the heart**: Knowing that everything is determined by the Wise, the All-Knowing

> "No disaster strikes upon the earth or among yourselves except that it is in a register before We bring it into being. Indeed, that is easy for Allah. In order that you not despair over what has eluded you and not exult over what He has given you." (Al-Hadid 57:22-23)

2. **Courage**: Knowing that what is written will happen, and that death has its appointed time

3. **Humility**: Recognizing that our successes come from Allah

4. **Patience in trials**: Knowing that it is a test from Allah

5. **Gratitude for blessings**: Thanking the One who decreed the good

## What the Believer Should Say Regarding Destiny

### In case of misfortune

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> "The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer, and in each there is good. Strive for that which benefits you and seek help from Allah, and do not be helpless. If something befalls you, do not say: 'If only I had done such-and-such, it would have been such-and-such.' Rather say: 'Qadarullah wa ma sha'a fa'al' (Allah has decreed and what He willed, He did). For 'if' opens the door to the devil." (Sahih Muslim 2664)

### In case of blessing

> "Say: 'All is from Allah.'" (An-Nisa 4:78)

And thank Allah: "Alhamdulillah" (Praise be to Allah).

## 🛡️ Refutation of Doubts (الشُّبُهات والرد عليها)

### First Doubt: "If Allah has written everything, why does He punish us?"

**❌ The Doubt:** "If Allah knew and wrote that I would sin, it's not my fault!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Allah's knowledge does not force action:**
   Allah knows the future, but His knowledge does not force you to act.
   
   Example: A teacher knows his student will fail. Did the teacher force him to fail?

2. **You have real choice:**
   > ﴿فَمَن شَاءَ فَلْيُؤْمِن وَمَن شَاءَ فَلْيَكْفُرْ﴾
   > "Whoever wills - let him believe; and whoever wills - let him disbelieve." [Al-Kahf: 29]

3. **Ibn Taymiyyah رحمه الله explained:**
   > *"Man does not feel any compulsion when he acts. He acts by his choice, and then is accountable."*

---

### Second Doubt: "Divine decree removes human responsibility"

**❌ The Doubt:** "If everything is written, I am not responsible for my sins!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **The sinner does not know his destiny:**
   You don't know what is written. You act by your choice.

2. **Adam عليه السلام's argument:**
   When Adam blamed destiny for eating from the tree, this was not accepted as an excuse for the sin, but as acknowledgment of Allah's decree after repentance.

3. **Both are compatible:**
   Allah's decree and human responsibility coexist without contradiction.

---

### Third Doubt: "Why does Allah allow evil if He is Good?"

**❌ The Doubt:** "If Allah is Good, why did He create evil?"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **There is no absolute evil:**
   What appears evil may contain hidden good.
   > ﴿وَعَسَىٰ أَن تَكْرَهُوا شَيْئًا وَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ﴾
   > "Perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you." [Al-Baqarah: 216]

2. **Evil tests and purifies:**
   Trials elevate ranks and erase sins.

3. **Good and evil are from Allah's wisdom:**
   Allah creates everything, and His wisdom is complete.

---

### Fourth Doubt: "Why strive if everything is already written?"

**❌ The Doubt:** "If my destiny is written, why should I work?"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Means are part of destiny:**
   The Prophet ﷺ said:
   > **«اعْمَلُوا فَكُلٌّ مُيَسَّرٌ لِمَا خُلِقَ لَهُ»**
   > "Work, for everyone is facilitated toward what he was created for." (Al-Bukhari 4949)

2. **You don't know your destiny:**
   Work as if everything depends on you, and trust as if everything depends on Allah.

3. **The Companions understood:**
   They were the most believing in destiny and the most active in good deeds.

---

### Fifth Doubt: "Predestination is fatalism"

**❌ The Doubt:** "Your belief is fatalism that leads to surrender!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Islam is neither fatalism nor denial of destiny:**
   It is the middle path: affirmation of destiny with affirmation of choice.

2. **The Prophet ﷺ was the most active:**
   Despite his firm belief in destiny, he was the most striving in worship and jihad.

3. **Destiny motivates, not paralyzes:**
   Knowing that success is from Allah motivates humility and gratitude.

### The Story of 'Umar رضي الله عنه and the Plague

When 'Umar رضي الله عنه came to Sham and learned of the plague, he decided to return.

Abu 'Ubaydah said: "Do you flee from Allah's decree?"
