<div class="scene-box">

**🌍 The Founding Incident: Omar Facing the Plague**

*Year 18 of the Hijra. The Caliph Omar ibn al-Khattab رضي الله عنه leads his army toward Sham...*

*At Sargh, an exhausted rider arrives...*

**Rider:** « O Commander of the Faithful! **The plague** is devastating Sham. Thousands are dying each day! »

*Omar gathers the Companions. The debate rages...*

**Some Muhajirun:** « We set out for Allah's cause. We do not flee! »

**Some Ansar:** « Better to return and protect the Muslims. »

*Abdurrahman ibn Awf enters — he had been away:*

**Abdurrahman ibn Awf:** « I have knowledge! I heard the Prophet ﷺ say: **"If you hear that a plague has broken out in a land, do not enter it. And if it breaks out where you are, do not leave fleeing from it."** »

*Omar orders the return. Abu Ubayda rises, astonished:*

**Abu Ubayda:** « **Are you fleeing from Allah's decree**, O Omar?! »

*Omar turns with conviction:*

**Omar:** « Yes, **we flee from Allah's decree to Allah's decree!** »

**Omar:** « If there was a valley with two sides—one **fertile**, one **barren**—would you not graze in the fertile one? Yet that too would be by **Allah's decree**. »

*(Sahih Al-Bukhari 5729)*

### 2️⃣ Writing

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Decreed Before Creation**

> **"Allah wrote the decrees of creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth."**

*(Sahih Muslim 2653)*

</div>

### 3️⃣ Will

> ﴿And you do not will except that **Allah wills** — Lord of the worlds.﴾ [At-Takwir: 29]

## ⚖️ Man Between Destiny and Free Will

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Does man have will? | **Yes**: ﴿For whoever wills among you to take a right course.﴾ |
| Is it independent? | **No**: ﴿You do not will except that Allah wills.﴾ |
| Is he responsible? | **Yes**: Because he truly chooses |

<div class="scene-box">

**🎓 The Teacher and Student Example**

*A teacher knows his students well...*

**Teacher:** *(thinking)* « This student never studies... I know he will fail. »

*The student fails indeed...*

**Question:** Did the teacher's **knowledge** **force** the student to fail?

**Answer:** No! The student failed by **his choice**. The teacher merely **knew**.

**Likewise with Allah's knowledge**: He knows what you will choose, but He does **not force** you.

## 🛡️ Refutations of Doubts

### Doubt 1: "If everything is written, why should we work?"

<div class="scene-box">

**🗣️ Dialogue with the Companions**

**Companions:** « O Messenger of Allah! Should we not rely on our destiny and leave action? »

**The Prophet ﷺ:** « No! **Work, for everyone is facilitated toward what he was created for.** »

*(Sahih Al-Bukhari 4949)*

</div>

| Argument | Refutation |
|----------|------------|
| What is written will happen | But you don't know what is written! |
| Why exhaust myself? | Means are **part of** destiny |
| Example | Do you say: I'll be cured without medicine? |

---

### Doubt 2: "Divine decree forces man!"

**✅ Refutation:**

1. ﴿Be he **grateful** or be he **ungrateful**﴾ — If forced, why say **"or"**?

2. **You distinguish voluntary from involuntary**: Rain falling on you ≠ your prayer

3. **If forced, there would be no accountability**

## 📜 The Story of 'Urwah ibn az-Zubayr

<div class="scene-box">

**⚰️ The Double Trial**

*In a single night: 'Urwah's leg is amputated due to gangrene, and his son dies from a horse fall...*

*Mourners arrive...*

**'Urwah:** *(with remarkable steadfastness)*

> « **O Allah, all praise is Yours!** If You have taken, You have also **left**. If You have afflicted, You have also **healed**. »

> « You took **one limb** but left **many limbs**. You took **one son** but left **many sons**. »

*This is belief in divine decree: no despair, but praise and submission.*

## 🤲 Supplication

<div class="quote-box">

> **O Allah, I ask You for contentment with Your decree, and the coolness of life after death, and the pleasure of looking at Your Face, and longing to meet You.**

> **O Allah, whatever You have decreed for us, make its outcome good for us.**

</div>

**O Lord, increase me in knowledge!** 📖`

**❌ The Doubt:** "If Allah knew and wrote that I would sin, it's not my fault!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Allah's knowledge does not force action:**
   Allah knows the future, but His knowledge does not force you to act.
   
   Example: A teacher knows his student will fail. Did the teacher force him to fail?

2. **You have real choice:**
   > ﴿فَمَن شَاءَ فَلْيُؤْمِن وَمَن شَاءَ فَلْيَكْفُرْ﴾
   > "Whoever wills - let him believe; and whoever wills - let him disbelieve." [Al-Kahf: 29]

3. **Ibn Taymiyyah رحمه الله explained:**
   > *"Man does not feel any compulsion when he acts. He acts by his choice, and then is accountable."*

---

### Second Doubt: "Divine decree removes human responsibility"

**❌ The Doubt:** "If everything is written, I am not responsible for my sins!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **The sinner does not know his destiny:**
   You don't know what is written. You act by your choice.

2. **Adam عليه السلام's argument:**
   When Adam blamed destiny for eating from the tree, this was not accepted as an excuse for the sin, but as acknowledgment of Allah's decree after repentance.

3. **Both are compatible:**
   Allah's decree and human responsibility coexist without contradiction.

---

### Third Doubt: "Why does Allah allow evil if He is Good?"

**❌ The Doubt:** "If Allah is Good, why did He create evil?"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **There is no absolute evil:**
   What appears evil may contain hidden good.
   > ﴿وَعَسَىٰ أَن تَكْرَهُوا شَيْئًا وَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ﴾
   > "Perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you." [Al-Baqarah: 216]

2. **Evil tests and purifies:**
   Trials elevate ranks and erase sins.

3. **Good and evil are from Allah's wisdom:**
   Allah creates everything, and His wisdom is complete.

---

### Fourth Doubt: "Why strive if everything is already written?"

**❌ The Doubt:** "If my destiny is written, why should I work?"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Means are part of destiny:**
   The Prophet ﷺ said:
   > **«اعْمَلُوا فَكُلٌّ مُيَسَّرٌ لِمَا خُلِقَ لَهُ»**
   > "Work, for everyone is facilitated toward what he was created for." (Al-Bukhari 4949)

2. **You don't know your destiny:**
   Work as if everything depends on you, and trust as if everything depends on Allah.

3. **The Companions understood:**
   They were the most believing in destiny and the most active in good deeds.

---

### Fifth Doubt: "Predestination is fatalism"

**❌ The Doubt:** "Your belief is fatalism that leads to surrender!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Islam is neither fatalism nor denial of destiny:**
   It is the middle path: affirmation of destiny with affirmation of choice.

2. **The Prophet ﷺ was the most active:**
   Despite his firm belief in destiny, he was the most striving in worship and jihad.

3. **Destiny motivates, not paralyzes:**
   Knowing that success is from Allah motivates humility and gratitude.

### 'Umar and the Plague

When 'Umar رضي الله عنه came to Sham and learned of the plague, he decided to return.

Abu 'Ubaydah said: "Do you flee from Allah's decree?"
