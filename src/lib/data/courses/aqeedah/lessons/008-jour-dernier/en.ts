<div class="scene-box">

## The Day When the Sun Will Be a Mile from the Heads

Imagine this scene. It will be a day when the sun does not rise from the east—it blazes directly above people's heads, so close that they will be drowning in their own sweat.

The Prophet ﷺ described:

> *"The sun will be brought near the people on the Day of Resurrection until it is only a mile away. People will be in their sweat according to their deeds: some up to their ankles, some up to their knees, some up to their waists, and some will have the sweat reaching up to their mouths like a bridle."* (Sahih Muslim 2864)

On that day, the dead will emerge from their graves. The heavens will split apart. The mountains will become dust. Every soul will stand alone before Allah, with nothing but their deeds to speak for them.

No one knows the date. Not the angels, not the prophets, not even Muhammad ﷺ.

**But what exactly happens on that Day? And how do we prepare for it?**

</div>

## 🔍 Definition

Belief in the Last Day means having firm faith in everything that will happen after death: the punishment and bliss of the grave, the Resurrection, the Gathering, the Judgment, the Balance, the Bridge (Sirat), Paradise and Hell.

## Proof of the obligation of this belief

Allah ﷻ says:

> "Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but true righteousness is in one who believes in Allah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book, and the Prophets." (Al-Baqara 2:177)

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> "When the deceased is placed in his grave, two angels come to him and ask: 'Who is your Lord? What is your religion? Who is your prophet?'" (Sahih Muslim)

#### The punishment and bliss of the grave

> "The Fire, they are exposed to it morning and evening. And the Day the Hour appears, it will be said: 'Make the people of Pharaon enter the severest punishment.'" (Ghafir 40:46)

The Prophet ﷺ used to seek refuge from the punishment of the grave in every prayer:

> **"O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the punishment of the grave, from the trial of the Dajjal, and from the trials of life and death."**

## 🛡️ Refutation of Doubts (الشُّبُهات والرد عليها)

### First Doubt: "The resurrection of bodies is impossible"

**❌ The Doubt:** Some say: "How can decomposed bodies come back to life?"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **The One who created can recreate:**
   > ﴿أَوَلَيْسَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِقَادِرٍ عَلَىٰ أَن يَخْلُقَ مِثْلَهُم﴾
   > "Is not He who created the heavens and the earth Able to create the likes of them?" [Ya-Sin: 81]

2. **The first creation is more difficult:**
   > ﴿وَهُوَ الَّذِي يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ﴾
   > "It is He who originates creation and then repeats it, and it is easier for Him." [Ar-Rum: 27]

3. **The example of dead earth:**
   > ﴿وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ أَنَّكَ تَرَى الْأَرْضَ خَاشِعَةً فَإِذَا أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهَا الْمَاءَ اهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ﴾
   > "Among His signs is that you see the earth barren, but when We send down water upon it, it stirs and swells." [Fussilat: 39]

---

### Second Doubt: "Eternal Hell is unjust"

**❌ The Doubt:** "How can a finite sin deserve infinite punishment?"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **It is the intention that counts:**
   The disbeliever would have persisted in disbelief eternally if they had lived eternally.

2. **Rejection of Allah is infinite in gravity:**
   Denying the Creator of the universe is not an ordinary sin.

3. **Allah has warned clearly:**
   > ﴿وَأَنذِرْهُمْ يَوْمَ الْحَسْرَةِ﴾
   > "And warn them of the Day of Regret." [Maryam: 39]

4. **Justice belongs to Allah:**
   He is the Most Just and Most Wise. His justice is perfect.

### Third Doubt: "No one has come back to testify"

**❌ The Doubt:** "No one has returned from death to confirm the Hereafter!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Belief in the unseen is the foundation:**
   > ﴿الَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْغَيْبِ﴾
   > "Those who believe in the unseen." [Al-Baqarah: 3]

2. **The prophets are the witnesses:**
   They received revelation and transmitted the truth.

3. **The Prophet ﷺ saw:**
   He saw Paradise and Hell during the Isra' and Mi'raj.

4. **The signs are numerous:**
   Daily death, sleep as a small death, nature that is reborn...

---

### Fourth Doubt: "The material Paradise is primitive"

**❌ The Doubt:** "Why is Paradise described with physical pleasures like food and spouses?"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Allah addresses all humans:**
   The mentioned pleasures are understandable by everyone.

2. **Paradise contains what cannot be imagined:**
   > **«فِيهَا مَا لَا عَيْنٌ رَأَتْ، وَلَا أُذُنٌ سَمِعَتْ، وَلَا خَطَرَ عَلَى قَلْبِ بَشَرٍ»**
   > "In it is what no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and what has never come to the mind of a human." (Al-Bukhari 7498)

3. **The greatest joy is seeing Allah:**
   > ﴿وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ نَّاضِرَةٌ ۞ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهَا نَاظِرَةٌ﴾
   > "Faces that Day will be radiant, looking at their Lord." [Al-Qiyamah: 22-23]

---

### Fifth Doubt: "The signs of the Hour have already passed"

**❌ The Doubt:** "The minor signs have passed, why hasn't the Hour come?"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Only Allah knows the Hour:**
   > ﴿إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ﴾
   > "Indeed, Allah alone has knowledge of the Hour." [Luqman: 34]

2. **The major signs have not yet appeared:**
   The Dajjal, the descent of 'Issa, Ya'juj and Ma'juj...

3. **The Hour will come suddenly:**
   > ﴿لَا تَأْتِيكُمْ إِلَّا بَغْتَةً﴾
   > "It will only come upon you suddenly." [Al-A'raf: 187]
