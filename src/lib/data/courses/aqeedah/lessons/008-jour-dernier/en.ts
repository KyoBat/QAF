**🌅 The Day When the Sun Draws Near**

*That Day, the sun does not rise from the east... It descends upon people's heads...*

*Close. Very close. One mile away...*

**The Prophet ﷺ:** « **The sun will be brought near the people on the Day of Resurrection until it is only a mile away.** »

*(Sahih Muslim 2864)*

*On that Day, the dead emerge from their graves. The heavens split. The mountains become dust. Every soul stands **alone** before Allah...*

*No one knows when. Not the angels. Not the prophets. Not even Muhammad ﷺ.*

> ﴿They ask you about the Hour: when is its arrival? Say: **"Its knowledge is only with my Lord."**﴾ [Al-A'raf: 187]

## 🛡️ Refutation of Doubts (الشُّبُهات والرد عليها)

### First Doubt: "The resurrection of bodies is impossible"

**❌ The Doubt:** Some say: "How can decomposed bodies come back to life?"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **The One who created can recreate:**
   > ﴿أَوَلَيْسَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِقَادِرٍ عَلَىٰ أَن يَخْلُقَ مِثْلَهُم﴾
   > "Is not He who created the heavens and the earth Able to create the likes of them?" [Ya-Sin: 81]

2. **The first creation is more difficult:**
   > ﴿وَهُوَ الَّذِي يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ﴾
   > "It is He who originates creation and then repeats it, and it is easier for Him." [Ar-Rum: 27]

3. **The example of dead earth:**
   > ﴿وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ أَنَّكَ تَرَى الْأَرْضَ خَاشِعَةً فَإِذَا أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهَا الْمَاءَ اهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ﴾
   > "Among His signs is that you see the earth barren, but when We send down water upon it, it stirs and swells." [Fussilat: 39]

---

### Second Doubt: "Eternal Hell is unjust"

**❌ The Doubt:** "How can a finite sin deserve infinite punishment?"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **It is the intention that counts:**
   The disbeliever would have persisted in disbelief eternally if they had lived eternally.

2. **Rejection of Allah is infinite in gravity:**
   Denying the Creator of the universe is not an ordinary sin.

3. **Allah has warned clearly:**
   > ﴿وَأَنذِرْهُمْ يَوْمَ الْحَسْرَةِ﴾
   > "And warn them of the Day of Regret." [Maryam: 39]

4. **Justice belongs to Allah:**
   He is the Most Just and Most Wise. His justice is perfect.

---

### Third Doubt: "No one has come back to testify"

**❌ The Doubt:** "No one has returned from death to confirm the Hereafter!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Belief in the unseen is the foundation:**
   > ﴿الَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْغَيْبِ﴾
   > "Those who believe in the unseen." [Al-Baqarah: 3]

2. **The prophets are the witnesses:**
   They received revelation and transmitted the truth.

3. **The Prophet ﷺ saw:**
   He saw Paradise and Hell during the Isra' and Mi'raj.

4. **The signs are numerous:**
   Daily death, sleep as a small death, nature that is reborn...

---

### Fourth Doubt: "The material Paradise is primitive"

**❌ The Doubt:** "Why is Paradise described with physical pleasures like food and spouses?"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Allah addresses all humans:**
   The mentioned pleasures are understandable by everyone.

2. **Paradise contains what cannot be imagined:**
   > **«فِيهَا مَا لَا عَيْنٌ رَأَتْ، وَلَا أُذُنٌ سَمِعَتْ، وَلَا خَطَرَ عَلَى قَلْبِ بَشَرٍ»**
   > "In it is what no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and what has never come to the mind of a human." (Al-Bukhari 7498)

3. **The greatest joy is seeing Allah:**
   > ﴿وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ نَّاضِرَةٌ ۞ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهَا نَاظِرَةٌ﴾
   > "Faces that Day will be radiant, looking at their Lord." [Al-Qiyamah: 22-23]

---

### Fifth Doubt: "The signs of the Hour have already passed"

**❌ The Doubt:** "The minor signs have passed, why hasn't the Hour come?"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Only Allah knows the Hour:**
   > ﴿إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ﴾
   > "Indeed, Allah alone has knowledge of the Hour." [Luqman: 34]

2. **The major signs have not yet appeared:**
   The Dajjal, the descent of 'Issa, Ya'juj and Ma'juj...

3. **The Hour will come suddenly:**
   > ﴿لَا تَأْتِيكُمْ إِلَّا بَغْتَةً﴾
   > "It will only come upon you suddenly." [Al-A'raf: 187]
