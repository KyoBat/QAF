## Introduction

The Islamic creed has defined sources that must not be exceeded. These are divine sources, preserved from error and distortion. From where do we take our creed?

Allah ﷻ says:

> "O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. And if you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger." (An-Nisa 4:59)

---

## First Source: The Noble Quran

### Definition

The speech of Allah revealed to His Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, whose recitation is an act of worship, transmitted to us through continuous transmission (tawatur).

### Why is the Quran the first source?

1. **It is Allah's direct speech:**
   > "And indeed, it is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds. The Trustworthy Spirit (Jibril) has brought it down upon your heart that you may be of the warners." (Ash-Shu'ara 26:192-194)

2. **Preserved from distortion:**
   > "Indeed, it is We who sent down the Reminder and indeed, We will be its guardian." (Al-Hijr 15:9)

3. **Absolutely authentic:**
   Transmitted through tawatur (continuous transmission) generation after generation.

4. **Contains the foundations of the religion:**
   > "We have not neglected in the Book a thing." (Al-An'am 6:38)

### Examples of verses on creed

- Tawhid: ﴿Say: "He is Allah, the One"﴾
- Names and Attributes: ﴿There is nothing like unto Him﴾
- Belief in Angels: ﴿And the Angels exalt their Lord﴾
- The Last Day: ﴿The Day when mankind will stand before the Lord of the worlds﴾

## Second Source: The Authentic Prophetic Sunnah

### Definition

What emanated from the Prophet ﷺ in terms of sayings, actions, or approvals.

### The authority of the Sunnah in matters of creed

1. **The command to obey the Messenger ﷺ:**
   > "And whatever the Messenger has given you, take; and what he has forbidden you, refrain from." (Al-Hashr 59:7)

2. **The Sunnah is revelation:**
   > "Nor does he speak from his own desire. It is not but a revelation revealed." (An-Najm 53:3-4)

3. **The Sunnah explains the Quran:**
   > "And We revealed to you the Reminder that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them." (An-Nahl 16:44)

### Conditions for using hadith as proof in matters of creed

1. **Authenticity of the chain:** Continuity of the chain with trustworthy narrators
2. **Authenticity of the text:** No contradiction with the Quran and authentic hadiths
3. **Authentic ahad hadiths are proof in matters of creed** according to Ahl as-Sunnah

Imam Ash-Shafi'i رحمه الله said:
> **"The proof is the Book of Allah, the Sunnah of His Messenger ﷺ, and what the scholars have agreed upon."**

### Examples of hadiths on creed

- The hadith of Jibril on the pillars of faith (Sahih Muslim 8)
- Hadiths on the Names and Attributes
- Hadiths on the Barzakh and the Last Day
- Hadiths on Destiny

## Third Source: The Consensus of the Righteous Predecessors

### Definition of consensus

The agreement of the mujtahid scholars of the Ummah in a given era on a religious ruling.

### The authority of consensus

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **"My Ummah will never agree upon misguidance."**
> (Reported by Ibn Majah, authenticated by Al-Albani)

Allah ﷻ says:

> "And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers, We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell." (An-Nisa 4:115)

### Who are the Righteous Predecessors (Salaf)?

1. **The Companions رضي الله عنهم**
2. **The Tabi'in (successors)**
3. **The successors of the Tabi'in**

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **"The best of people are my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them."**
> (Sahih Bukhari 2652, Sahih Muslim 2533)

### The importance of the Salaf's understanding

> "So if they believe in the same as you believe in, then they have been rightly guided." (Al-Baqara 2:137)

Ibn Mas'ud رضي الله عنه said:
> **"Whoever wants to follow an example, let him follow those who have died. Those are the Companions of Muhammad ﷺ."**

## What is not a source of creed

### 1. Pure reason

Reason is used for understanding, not for legislating. We do not give precedence to reason over the text.

> "It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should have any choice about their affair." (Al-Ahzab 33:36)

### 2. Mystical unveiling and inspiration

These are not relied upon to establish creed.

### 3. Dreams and visions

These are not sources of legislation or creed.

### 4. Sayings of theologians and philosophers

They often contradict the methodology of the Salaf.

### 5. Weak and fabricated hadiths

These are not used as proofs in matters of creed.

## 🛡️ Refutation of Doubts

### First doubt: "The Quran is enough, no need for Sunnah!"

**❌ The doubt:** "We suffice with the Quran, no need for the Sunnah!"

**✅ The response:**

1. **The Quran commands following the Messenger:**
   > "And whatever the Messenger has given you, take it." (Al-Hashr 59:7)

2. **The Sunnah is revelation from Allah:**
   > "Nor does he speak from his own desire." (An-Najm 53:3)

3. **The Sunnah explains the Quran:**
   How do we pray? How do we perform Hajj? How do we give Zakat? All of this is in the Sunnah!

4. **The Prophet ﷺ said:**
   > **"Indeed, I have been given the Book and its like with it."** (Abu Dawud 4604)

---

### Second doubt: "Reason takes priority over text!"

**❌ The doubt:** "If reason contradicts the text, we prioritize reason!"

**✅ The response:**

1. **There is no real contradiction:**
   Authentic revelation does not contradict sound reason.

2. **Reason is limited:**
   > "And you have not been given of knowledge except a little." (Al-Isra 17:85)

3. **Revelation comes from the All-Knowing, the Wise:**
   Allah's knowledge is more complete than ours.

4. **Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said:**
   > *"Every rational argument that contradicts revelation is but an ambiguity, not a proof."*

## 📜 Stories and Narrations

### The story of Ibn Abbas and the Khawarij

When the Khawarij rebelled against Ali رضي الله عنه, he sent Ibn Abbas رضي الله عنهما to them.

He said to them: **"What do you hold against him?"**

They mentioned their doubts...

Ibn Abbas said: **"If I bring you from the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet ﷺ what refutes your claims, will you return?"**

They said: Yes.

**Two thousand of them returned to the truth!**

### The story of Imam Malik and the question about Istawa

Imam Malik رحمه الله was asked: How did He establish Himself?

He replied:

> **"The Istawa (establishment) is known, the how is unknown, believing in it is obligatory, and asking about it is an innovation."**

This is the methodology of the Salaf: we affirm what Allah and His Messenger affirmed, and we remain silent about what they remained silent about.

## 💎 Sayings of the Scholars

### Imam Ash-Shafi'i رحمه الله
