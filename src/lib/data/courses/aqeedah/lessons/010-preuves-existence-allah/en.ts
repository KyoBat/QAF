## 🎬 Prologue: The Existential Question

<div class="scene-box">

**🌙 A NIGHT IN THE DESERT**

*A bedouin raises his eyes to the star-filled sky. Millions of stars sparkle in the vast darkness. A traveler approaches him and asks:*

**The traveler:** "O bedouin, how do you know that God exists? You have never seen Him!"

*The bedouin smiled, pointing to the ground then to the sky:*

**The bedouin:** "**The camel droppings indicate the camel. The footprints indicate the walker. A sky with constellations, an earth with pathways, seas with waves... do these not indicate the Subtle, the All-Aware?!**"

*The traveler fell silent, his heart touched by this self-evident truth.*

</div>

Allah ﷻ says:

> **﴿أَفِي اللَّهِ شَكٌّ فَاطِرِ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ﴾**
> *"Can there be doubt about Allah, Creator of the heavens and earth?"* [Ibrāhīm: 10]

## 1️⃣ The Innate Proof (Al-Fitra) — The Cry of the Heart

### 💡 What is Fitra?

Imagine a child who was never raised upon any religion... Place him before the vastness of the universe, before a terrifying storm, before mortal danger... **To whom will he instinctively turn?**

This deep feeling, this inner voice that recognizes an Almighty Creator, is the **Fitra** — the original pure nature upon which Allah created every human being.

<div class="scene-box">

**⛵ SCENE: IN THE HEART OF THE STORM**

*A ship caught in a devastating storm. Waves rise like mountains. The sailors, many of whom were atheists, fall to their knees...*

**The sailors:** "O God! O God! Save us!"

*Allah describes this scene:*

> **﴿وَإِذَا مَسَّكُمُ الضُّرُّ فِي الْبَحْرِ ضَلَّ مَن تَدْعُونَ إِلَّا إِيَّاهُ﴾**
> *"And when adversity touches you at sea, lost are all those you invoke except for Him."* [Al-Isrā': 67]

</div>

### 📜 Proof from the Quran

> **﴿فَأَقِمْ وَجْهَكَ لِلدِّينِ حَنِيفًا ۚ فِطْرَتَ اللَّهِ الَّتِي فَطَرَ النَّاسَ عَلَيْهَا ۚ لَا تَبْدِيلَ لِخَلْقِ اللَّهِ﴾**
> *"So direct your face toward the religion, inclining to truth. Adhere to the Fitra of Allah upon which He has created all people. No change should there be in the creation of Allah."* [Ar-Rūm: 30]

### 📿 Proof from the Sunnah

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **"كُلُّ مَوْلُودٍ يُولَدُ عَلَى الْفِطْرَةِ، فَأَبَوَاهُ يُهَوِّدَانِهِ أَوْ يُنَصِّرَانِهِ أَوْ يُمَجِّسَانِهِ"**
> *"Every child is born upon the Fitra (natural disposition). It is his parents who make him a Jew, a Christian, or a Zoroastrian."*
> (Sahih Bukhari 1358, Sahih Muslim 2658)

### 🔑 The Primordial Covenant — The Day You Testified

<div class="scene-box">

**⏳ BEFORE TIME: THE COVENANT OF ALASTU**

*Before you came into this world, before your parents met, before Adam descended to earth... Allah gathered all the souls of humanity.*

*Imagine this grand scene: billions of souls, from Adam to the last human, all present before their Lord...*

**Allah ﷻ:** **"ألستُ بربكم؟ — Am I not your Lord?"**

**All the souls, in unison:** **"قَالُوا بَلَىٰ — Yes, we testify!"**

*You were there. You testified. You recognized your Lord.*

> **﴿وَإِذْ أَخَذَ رَبُّكَ مِن بَنِي آدَمَ مِن ظُهُورِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَأَشْهَدَهُمْ عَلَىٰ أَنفُسِهِمْ أَلَسْتُ بِرَبِّكُمْ ۖ قَالُوا بَلَىٰ﴾**
> *"And when your Lord took from the children of Adam, from their loins, their descendants and made them testify of themselves, saying: 'Am I not your Lord?' They said: 'Yes!'"* [Al-A'rāf: 172]

</div>

## 2️⃣ Second: The Sensory Proof

### Meaning of the sensory proof

It is what is perceived by the senses from Allah's signs in the universe and in the soul.

### 1️⃣ Allah's signs in the universe

> "We will show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth." (Fussilat 41:53)

**Examples:**
- The heavens, earth, and mountains
- The sun, moon, and stars
- The seas, rivers, and rain
- The night and day

> "Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of understanding." (Al Imran 3:190)

### 2️⃣ Allah's signs in the souls

> "And in yourselves. Then will you not see?" (Adh-Dhariyat 51:21)

**Examples:**
- The miraculous formation of the human being
- The five senses
- The intellect and the heart
- The stages of fetal development

> "And certainly did We create man from an extract of clay. Then We placed him as a sperm-drop in a firm lodging. Then We made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot, and We made the clot into a lump of flesh, and We made from the lump bones, and We covered the bones with flesh; then We developed him into another creation. So blessed is Allah, the best of creators." (Al-Mu'minun 23:12-14)

### 3️⃣ The answering of supplications

Among the sensory proofs: Allah's response to the supplications of His servants.

> "And when My servants ask you concerning Me, indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me." (Al-Baqara 2:186)

### 4️⃣ The miracles of the Prophets

People witnessed them with their own eyes:
- The splitting of the moon for the Prophet ﷺ
- The staff of Moses
- Jesus raising the dead by Allah's permission

---

## 3️⃣ Third: The Rational Proof

### 1️⃣ The proof of creation

> "Were they created by nothing, or were they the creators of themselves? Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Rather, they are not certain." (At-Tur 52:35-36)

**Rational analysis:**

Existing things have three possibilities:
1. **They came from nothing** — Rationally impossible
2. **They created themselves** — Rationally impossible
3. **A Creator created them** — This is the truth ✓

**The story of Jubayr ibn Mut'im:**

When he heard the Prophet ﷺ reciting this verse, he said: **"My heart almost flew away!"** This was the cause of his acceptance of Islam.

### 2️⃣ The proof of perfection and order

> "This is the work of Allah, who perfected all things." (An-Naml 27:88)

**Examples of perfection:**
- The rotation of planets with exact precision
- The ecological balance
- The complex human body
- The water cycle in nature

> "He who created seven heavens in layers. You do not see in the creation of the Most Merciful any inconsistency. So return your vision; do you see any breaks?" (Al-Mulk 67:3)

### 3️⃣ The proof of providence and management

> "It is Allah who erected the heavens without pillars that you can see; then He established Himself above the Throne and made subject the sun and the moon, each running for a specified term. He arranges each matter." (Ar-Ra'd 13:2)

Who manages this immense universe with such perfect order?

### 4️⃣ The proof of purpose (wisdom)

Everything in the universe has wisdom and purpose:
- The eye for seeing
- The ear for hearing
- The heart for pumping blood
- The sun for light and heat

> "Did you think that We created you uselessly and that to Us you would not be returned?" (Al-Mu'minun 23:115)

---

## 4️⃣ Fourth: The Scriptural Proof

### 1️⃣ The consensus of the Prophets

All prophets from Adam to Muhammad ﷺ came with one message: **La ilaha illa Allah**.

> "And We sent not before you any messenger except that We revealed to him that: 'There is no deity except Me, so worship Me.'" (Al-Anbiya 21:25)

### 2️⃣ The Divine Books

All revealed books testify to Allah's existence and His oneness.

### 3️⃣ The miracle of the Quran

The Quran is miraculous in its wording, meaning, legislation, and information about the unseen.

> "Say: 'If mankind and the jinn gathered in order to produce the like of this Quran, they could not produce the like of it.'" (Al-Isra 17:88)

---

## 🛡️ Refutation of Doubts

### First doubt: "Where is Allah? I don't see Him!"

**❌ The doubt:** "I only believe in what I see!"

**✅ The response:**

1. **Invisibility does not mean non-existence:**
   Do you see the air? Do you see the intellect? Do you see the soul?

2. **Our senses are limited:**
   We don't see ultraviolet rays or all sound waves.

3. **Allah informed us:**
   > "Vision perceives Him not, but He perceives all vision." (Al-An'am 6:103)

4. **Believers will see Him in Paradise:**
   > "Some faces, that Day, will be radiant, looking at their Lord." (Al-Qiyama 75:22-23)

---

### Second doubt: "The universe came by chance!"

**❌ The doubt:** "Everything came randomly through evolution and chance!"

**✅ The response:**

1. **Chance does not produce order:**
   Can a printing press explode and produce an organized dictionary?!

2. **Perfection indicates a Perfect Creator:**
   > "This is the work of Allah, who perfected all things." (An-Naml 27:88)

3. **The law of causality:**
   Every event must have a cause.

4. **Scientists say:**
   The probability of a single cell existing by chance = 1 ÷ 10^40000 (practically impossible!)

---

### Third doubt: "Who created Allah?"

**❌ The doubt:** "If everything has a creator, who created Allah?"

**✅ The response:**

1. **The question is fundamentally flawed:**
   Allah is not a "thing" that was created to need a creator.

2. **Allah is the First:**
   > "He is the First and the Last." (Al-Hadid 57:3)
   
   The Prophet ﷺ said: **"O Allah, You are the First, there is nothing before You."** (Sahih Muslim 2713)

3. **Infinite regress is impossible:**
   If every creator had a creator, nothing would have ever existed!

4. **There must be a Necessary Being:**
   There must be a being who exists by himself and needs no one.

---

### Fourth doubt: "Science is enough, no need for religion!"

**❌ The doubt:** "Science explains everything, no need for Allah!"

**✅ The response:**

1. **Science proves Allah's existence:**
   The more science advances, the more miracles appear!

2. **Science answers "how," not "why":**
   Science tells how the apple falls, not why it exists.

3. **Great scientists were believers:**
   Newton, Einstein, Pasteur... believed in a Creator.

4. **Science is limited:**
   Science cannot explain the soul, consciousness, and the unseen.
