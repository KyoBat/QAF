## The Oneness of Allah in Worship

<div class="scene-box">

**⚔️ PROLOGUE: The Day Ibrahim Smashed the Idols**

*Babylon, more than 4000 years ago. The city is deserted - everyone has gone to the annual idol festival.*

*A young man remains alone. He enters the temple. Dozens of statues stare at him with their stone eyes.*

*He takes an axe...*

*When the people return, they find their idols shattered - except the largest one, with the axe on its shoulder.*

**🗣️ They cry out:** "Who did this to our gods?!"

**🔵 Ibrahim:** *"Rather, this - the largest of them - did it. Ask them, if they can speak!"*

**🗣️ They confess:** "You know well that these do not speak!"

**🔵 Ibrahim:** **"Do you then worship besides Allah things that can neither benefit you nor harm you? Fie upon you and upon what you worship besides Allah! Do you not use your reason?"** (Al-Anbiya 21:66-67)

*That day, Ibrahim عليه السلام taught them the lesson of Tawheed Al-Uluhiyyah.*

## 🌟 Contemplative Introduction

Why were you created? What is the purpose of your existence in this life?

This question that has puzzled philosophers for centuries... Allah answered it in a single verse:

> ﴿وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ﴾
> *"And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me."* (Adh-Dhariyat 51:56)

**You exist to worship Allah!** This is Tawheed Al-Uluhiyyah.

---

## 📖 Definition

### Linguistic Meaning

**Al-Ilah (الإله)**: The deity that is worshipped. **Al-Uluhiyyah (الألوهية)**: Servitude and worship.

Hence Allah's saying ﷻ: ﴿وَهُوَ اللَّهُ﴾ meaning: the One truly worshipped.

### Religious Meaning

**Tawheed Al-Uluhiyyah**: It is **singling out Allah alone in all forms of worship, apparent and hidden, in speech and action.**

Sheikh Ibn Uthaymin رحمه الله said:
> *"It is singling out Allah alone in worship, by not taking any partner with Allah in His worship, just as He has no partner in His sovereignty."*

---

## 🎯 The Importance of Tawheed Al-Uluhiyyah

### 1️⃣ It is the supreme objective of sending the Messengers

> ﴿وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولًا أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ﴾
> *"And We certainly sent into every nation a messenger, [saying], 'Worship Allah and avoid Taghut'."* (An-Nahl 16:36)

Every Messenger told his people: **Worship Allah!**

### 2️⃣ It is the Tawheed in which the deficiency occurred

The polytheists acknowledged Tawheed Ar-Rububiyyah, but they associated others in **worship**.

> ﴿وَمَا يُؤْمِنُ أَكْثَرُهُم بِاللَّهِ إِلَّا وَهُم مُّشْرِكُونَ﴾
> *"And most of them believe not in Allah except while they associate others with Him."* (Yusuf 12:106)

### 3️⃣ By it, deeds are accepted or rejected

> ﴿فَمَن كَانَ يَرْجُو لِقَاءَ رَبِّهِ فَلْيَعْمَلْ عَمَلًا صَالِحًا وَلَا يُشْرِكْ بِعِبَادَةِ رَبِّهِ أَحَدًا﴾
> *"So whoever would hope for the meeting with his Lord - let him do righteous work and not associate in the worship of his Lord anyone."* (Al-Kahf 18:110)

---

## 📿 The Meaning of Worship

### Definition by Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah

> **"Worship: a comprehensive term for everything that Allah loves and is pleased with from statements and actions, apparent and hidden."**

### The Universality of Worship

Worship is not limited to prayer and fasting! It includes:
- **Worship of the heart**: love, fear, hope, trust, repentance
- **Worship of the tongue**: dhikr, supplication, istighfar, Quran recitation
- **Worship of the limbs**: prayer, fasting, hajj, jihad, charity

---

## 🕌 Types of Worship Reserved Exclusively for Allah

### 1️⃣ Supplication (Du'a)

> ﴿وَأَنَّ الْمَسَاجِدَ لِلَّهِ فَلَا تَدْعُوا مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَدًا﴾
> *"And the mosques are for Allah, so do not invoke anyone along with Allah."* (Al-Jinn 72:18)

The Prophet ﷺ said:
> **« الدُّعَاءُ هُوَ الْعِبَادَةُ »**
> *"Supplication is worship."* (Sunan At-Tirmidhi 3372 - Sahih)

**Whoever invokes other than Allah has committed shirk!**

### 2️⃣ Fear (Al-Khawf) - The Secret Fear

> ﴿فَلَا تَخَافُوهُمْ وَخَافُونِ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ﴾
> *"So do not fear them but fear Me, if you are believers."* (Al-Imran 3:175)

**The secret fear**: fearing someone other than Allah thinking they can harm you through supernatural power.

### 3️⃣ Hope (Ar-Raja)

> ﴿فَمَن كَانَ يَرْجُو لِقَاءَ رَبِّهِ فَلْيَعْمَلْ عَمَلًا صَالِحًا﴾
> *"So whoever would hope for the meeting with his Lord - let him do righteous work."* (Al-Kahf 18:110)

### 4️⃣ Trust (At-Tawakkul)

> ﴿وَعَلَى اللَّهِ فَتَوَكَّلُوا إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ﴾
> *"And upon Allah rely, if you are believers."* (Al-Ma'idah 5:23)

> ﴿وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ﴾
> *"And whoever relies upon Allah - then He is sufficient for him."* (At-Talaq 65:3)

### 5️⃣ Sacrifice and Vows

> ﴿قُلْ إِنَّ صَلَاتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ ۝ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ﴾
> *"Say, 'Indeed, my prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allah, Lord of the worlds. No partner has He.'"* (Al-An'am 6:162-163)

The Prophet ﷺ said:
> **« لَعَنَ اللَّهُ مَن ذَبَحَ لِغَيرِ اللهِ »**
> *"Allah has cursed whoever sacrifices for other than Allah."* (Sahih Muslim 1978)

### 6️⃣ Seeking Refuge and Help

> ﴿قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ الْفَلَقِ﴾
> *"Say, 'I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak'."* (Al-Falaq 1)

> ﴿إِذْ تَسْتَغِيثُونَ رَبَّكُمْ فَاسْتَجَابَ لَكُمْ﴾
> *"[Remember] when you asked help of your Lord, and He answered you."* (Al-Anfal 8:9)

### 7️⃣ Bowing and Prostration

> ﴿يَا مَرْيَمُ اقْنُتِي لِرَبِّكِ وَاسْجُدِي وَارْكَعِي مَعَ الرَّاكِعِينَ﴾
> *"O Mary, be devoutly obedient to your Lord and prostrate and bow with those who bow."* (Al-Imran 3:43)

## ⚖️ Difference Between Tawheed Ar-Rububiyyah and Tawheed Al-Uluhiyyah

| Tawheed Ar-Rububiyyah | Tawheed Al-Uluhiyyah |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Oneness of Allah in **His actions** | Oneness of Allah in **our actions** |
| Acknowledging that Allah is **the Creator, the Provider** | Singling out Allah **in worship** |
| The polytheists **acknowledged it** | The polytheists **denied it** |
| **Not sufficient** alone for Islam | It is the **reality of Islam** |

---

## ✅ Conditions for the Acceptance of Worship

### First Condition: Sincerity (Al-Ikhlas)

> ﴿وَمَا أُمِرُوا إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ﴾
> *"And they were not commanded except to worship Allah, [being] sincere to Him in religion."* (Al-Bayyinah 98:5)

The Prophet ﷺ said in the Hadith Qudsi:
> **« أَنَا أَغْنَى الشُّرَكَاءِ عَنِ الشِّرْكِ، مَنْ عَمِلَ عَمَلًا أَشْرَكَ فِيهِ مَعِي غَيْرِي تَرَكْتُهُ وَشِرْكَهُ »**
> *"I am the most self-sufficient of partners from shirk. Whoever does an action in which he associates others with Me, I will abandon him and his shirk."* (Sahih Muslim 2985)

### Second Condition: Following the Prophet ﷺ

> ﴿وَمَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانتَهُوا﴾
> *"And whatever the Messenger has given you - take; and what he has forbidden you - refrain from."* (Al-Hashr 59:7)

The Prophet ﷺ said:
> **« مَنْ عَمِلَ عَمَلًا لَيْسَ عَلَيْهِ أَمْرُنَا فَهُوَ رَدٌّ »**
> *"Whoever does an action that is not in accordance with our matter, it is rejected."* (Sahih Muslim 1718)

## ⚠️ Major Shirk: The Opposite of Tawheed Al-Uluhiyyah

### Its Definition

Directing any form of worship to other than Allah.

### Its Types

1. **Shirk of supplication**: Invoking other than Allah
2. **Shirk of intention and purpose**: Acting for other than Allah
3. **Shirk of obedience**: Obeying other than Allah in making permissible what is forbidden or forbidding what is permissible
4. **Shirk of love**: Loving other than Allah as one loves Allah or more

### Its Severity

> ﴿إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ﴾
> *"Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills."* (An-Nisa 4:48)

The Prophet ﷺ said:
> **« مَنْ مَاتَ وَهُوَ يَدْعُو مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ نِدًّا دَخَلَ النَّارَ »**
> *"Whoever dies while invoking an equal to Allah will enter the Fire."* (Sahih Al-Bukhari 4497)

---

## 🛡️ Refutation of Doubts (الشُّبُهات والرد عليها)

### First Doubt: "We don't worship the saints, we only intercede through them!"

**❌ The Doubt:** Some say: "We don't worship the saints and the righteous, we only intercede through them to Allah because they are closer to Him than us!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **This is exactly what the early polytheists said!**
   > ﴿وَالَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُوا مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلَّا لِيُقَرِّبُونَا إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَىٰ﴾
   > *"And those who take protectors besides Him [say], 'We only worship them that they may bring us nearer to Allah in position'."* (Az-Zumar 39:3)
   
   They said the same thing! "To bring us nearer to Allah"!

2. **Invoking the dead is worship of them:**
   Supplication is worship, so whoever invokes other than Allah has worshipped them.
   > ﴿وَأَنَّ الْمَسَاجِدَ لِلَّهِ فَلَا تَدْعُوا مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَدًا﴾
   > *"And the mosques are for Allah, so do not invoke anyone along with Allah."* (Al-Jinn 72:18)

3. **Allah is closer to you than anyone!**
   > ﴿وَإِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِي عَنِّي فَإِنِّي قَرِيبٌ ۖ أُجِيبُ دَعْوَةَ الدَّاعِ إِذَا دَعَانِ﴾
   > *"And when My servants ask you concerning Me - indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me."* (Al-Baqarah 2:186)
   
   He did not say: "Say: I am near", but He said: **"Indeed I am near"** directly!

4. **Sheikh Ibn Baz رحمه الله said:**
   > *"Whoever invokes the dead or the absent seeking their help has committed major shirk with Allah, even if he calls it intercession."*

---

### Second Doubt: "Istighatha (seeking help) from the righteous is not shirk!"

**❌ The Doubt:** "Istighatha from the saints is permissible because they are alive with their Lord!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Istighatha in what only Allah can accomplish = shirk:**
   > ﴿أَمَّن يُجِيبُ الْمُضْطَرَّ إِذَا دَعَاهُ وَيَكْشِفُ السُّوءَ﴾
   > *"Is He [not best] who responds to the desperate one when he calls upon Him and removes evil?"* (An-Naml 27:62)
   
   Allah alone responds to the desperate!

2. **The dead do not hear:**
   > ﴿إِنَّكَ لَا تُسْمِعُ الْمَوْتَىٰ﴾
   > *"Indeed, you will not make the dead hear."* (An-Naml 27:80)
   > ﴿وَمَا أَنتَ بِمُسْمِعٍ مَّن فِي الْقُبُورِ﴾
   > *"And you cannot make hear those in the graves."* (Fatir 35:22)

3. **The dead possess nothing:**
   > ﴿وَالَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ مَا يَمْلِكُونَ مِن قِطْمِيرٍ﴾
   > *"And those you invoke other than Him do not possess [even as much as] the membrane of a date seed."* (Fatir 35:13)
   
   (The Qitmir: the thin membrane on a date seed!)

4. **Even the Prophets cannot be sought for istighatha:**
   The Prophet ﷺ said about himself:
   > **« لَا أَمْلِكُ لَكُمْ مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئًا »**
   > *"I possess nothing for you from Allah."*
   
   Then what about those below him?!

---

### Third Doubt: "Sacrificing for the saint is an honor, not worship!"

**❌ The Doubt:** "We sacrifice near the grave to honor the saint, not to worship him!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Sacrifice is a great act of worship that is only for Allah:**
   > ﴿فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ وَانْحَرْ﴾
   > *"So pray to your Lord and sacrifice."* (Al-Kawthar 108:2)
   
   He paired prayer with sacrifice because both are acts of worship.

2. **Sacrificing for other than Allah is shirk and its doer is cursed:**
   > **« لَعَنَ اللَّهُ مَن ذَبَحَ لِغَيرِ اللهِ »**
   > *"Allah has cursed whoever sacrifices for other than Allah."* (Sahih Muslim 1978)

3. **What matters is the intention:**
   If sacrificed to draw near to the saint or hoping from him = shirk.
   If sacrificed for Allah near the grave = innovation and means to shirk.

4. **Sheikh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab رحمه الله said:**
   > *"Whoever sacrifices to draw near to other than Allah, like one who sacrifices for the jinn or for the grave, is a mushrik."*

---

### Fourth Doubt: "Making vows for the saint is permissible!"

**❌ The Doubt:** "I make a vow for the saint so-and-so if my son is healed!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Vowing is an act of worship:**
   > ﴿يُوفُونَ بِالنَّذْرِ﴾
   > *"They fulfill [their] vows."* (Al-Insan 76:7)
   
   Allah praised the believers for fulfilling vows, proving it is an act of worship.

2. **Directing worship to other than Allah is shirk:**
   Whoever makes a vow for other than Allah is like whoever prays to other than Allah!

3. **The saint possesses neither benefit nor harm:**
   > ﴿قُل لَّا أَمْلِكُ لِنَفْسِي نَفْعًا وَلَا ضَرًّا إِلَّا مَا شَاءَ اللَّهُ﴾
   > *"Say, 'I hold not for myself [the power of] benefit or harm, except what Allah has willed'."* (Al-A'raf 7:188)

4. **The scholars said:**
   A vow made to other than Allah is void, even if the one for whom the vow is made is righteous.

---

### Fifth Doubt: "Seeking blessings (tabarruk) from the traces of the righteous is permissible!"

**❌ The Doubt:** "The Companions sought blessings from the traces of the Prophet ﷺ, so why can't we seek blessings from the traces of saints?"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Tabarruk from the Prophet's ﷺ traces is specific to him:**
   It is not reported that the Companions sought blessings from Abu Bakr or 'Umar رضي الله عنهما!

2. **No one sought blessings from the Prophet's ﷺ grave!**
   The Companions did not touch his grave nor did they turn to it to invoke.

3. **Blocking the means (to evil):**
   Tabarruk from the righteous is a means to shirk, which is why the scholars forbade it.

4. **Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah رحمه الله said:**
   > *"Tabarruk from the Prophet's ﷺ traces was during his lifetime. After his death, this is not reported, and as for other righteous people, the Companions did not do this with Abu Bakr and 'Umar."*

---

### Sixth Doubt: "You make takfir of Muslims!"

**❌ The Doubt:** "Anyone who warns against these acts makes takfir of Muslims and excludes them from Islam!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Difference between the act and the actor:**
   The act may be shirk, but the actor may be ignorant or have a mistaken interpretation.

2. **Takfir has conditions:**
   A specific person is not declared a disbeliever until proof is established against them, conditions are met, and impediments are removed.

3. **The goal is clarification, not takfir:**
   > ﴿لِتُبَيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ مَا نُزِّلَ إِلَيْهِمْ﴾
   > *"So that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them."* (An-Nahl 16:44)
   
   We clarify the truth so that people may follow it.

4. **Sheikh Ibn Uthaymin رحمه الله said:**
   > *"Judging acts as shirk does not necessarily mean making takfir of the actor, as he may be ignorant or mistaken."*

## 📜 Stories and Traditions on Tawheed Al-Uluhiyyah

### The Story of Ibrahim عليه السلام with His People

<div class="scene-box">

Ibrahim said to his father and his people:

> ﴿مَا هَٰذِهِ التَّمَاثِيلُ الَّتِي أَنتُمْ لَهَا عَاكِفُونَ﴾
> *"What are these statues to which you are devoted?"* (Al-Anbiya 21:52)

Then he smashed their idols and left the biggest one. When they questioned him, he said:

> ﴿بَلْ فَعَلَهُ كَبِيرُهُمْ هَٰذَا فَاسْأَلُوهُمْ إِن كَانُوا يَنطِقُونَ﴾
> *"Rather, this - the largest of them - did it, so ask them, if they should [be able to] speak."* (Al-Anbiya 21:63)

**They acknowledged the truth:**
> ﴿لَقَدْ عَلِمْتَ مَا هَٰؤُلَاءِ يَنطِقُونَ﴾
> *"You have already known that these do not speak!"* (Al-Anbiya 21:65)

He established the proof against them:
> ﴿أَفَتَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لَا يَنفَعُكُمْ شَيْئًا وَلَا يَضُرُّكُمْ﴾
> *"Then do you worship instead of Allah that which does not benefit you at all or harm you?"* (Al-Anbiya 21:66)

</div>

### The Story of 'Adi ibn Hatim رضي الله عنه

<div class="scene-box">

'Adi ibn Hatim came while he was a Christian, and he heard the Prophet ﷺ reciting:

> ﴿اتَّخَذُوا أَحْبَارَهُمْ وَرُهْبَانَهُمْ أَرْبَابًا مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ﴾
> *"They have taken their scholars and monks as lords besides Allah."* (At-Tawbah 9:31)

'Adi said: **"We did not worship them!"**

The Prophet ﷺ said:
> **« أَلَيْسَ يُحَرِّمُونَ مَا أَحَلَّ اللَّهُ فَتُحَرِّمُونَهُ، وَيُحِلُّونَ مَا حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ فَتَسْتَحِلُّونَهُ؟ »**
> *"Did they not make unlawful what Allah made lawful and you made it unlawful, and did they not make lawful what Allah forbade and you made it lawful?"*

He said: Yes.

He said: **« فَتِلْكَ عِبَادَتُهُمْ »** *"That is their worship of them."* (Hadith graded good by Al-Albani)

### The Story of the Companions with Dhat Anwat

<div class="scene-box">

During the battle of Hunayn, the Companions passed by a tree on which the polytheists would hang their weapons seeking blessings from it, called "Dhat Anwat".

Some newly converted Companions said: **"O Messenger of Allah, make for us a Dhat Anwat like they have a Dhat Anwat!"**

The Prophet ﷺ said:
> **« اللَّهُ أَكْبَرُ! إِنَّهَا السُّنَنُ! قُلْتُمْ وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ كَمَا قَالَتْ بَنُو إِسْرَائِيلَ لِمُوسَى: اجْعَل لَّنَا إِلَٰهًا كَمَا لَهُمْ آلِهَةٌ »**
> *"Allahu Akbar! These are the same ways! You have said, by the One in whose Hand is my soul, just as the Children of Israel said to Musa: 'Make for us a god just as they have gods'."* (Declared authentic by Al-Albani)

</div>

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf: Sa'id ibn Jubayr and Sincere Worship

<div class="story-box">

**In the time of Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf Ath-Thaqafi**, the noble Tabi'i Sa'id ibn Jubayr رحمه الله was among the greatest scholars.

When he was brought to Al-Hajjaj to be executed, Al-Hajjaj said mockingly: **"You are Sa'id (happy) ibn Jubayr? Rather, you are Shaqi (wretched) ibn Kusayr (broken)!"**

Sa'id said firmly: **"My mother named me Sa'id, and she knew better!"**

Al-Hajjaj said: **"Choose for yourself whatever death you wish!"**

Sa'id رحمه الله said: **"Rather, choose for yourself! By Allah, you will not kill me with any killing except that Allah will kill you the same way on the Day of Resurrection!"**

Then he turned towards the Qiblah and said: ﴿وَجَّهْتُ وَجْهِيَ لِلَّذِي فَطَرَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ حَنِيفًا وَمَا أَنَا مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ﴾ *"I have turned my face toward He who created the heavens and the earth, inclining toward truth, and I am not of those who associate others with Allah."*

He was killed رحمه الله, and not long after, Al-Hajjaj died in severe distress.

</div>

**📌 The Lesson**: Sa'id ibn Jubayr directed his worship to Allah alone, even in the moment of death. He did not fear the creation because he knew that the One who harms and benefits is Allah alone.

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases: Tawheed Al-Uluhiyyah in Our Lives

### Case 1: Amulets and the Blue Bead
**Situation**: A mother hangs a blue bead on her infant's chest "to protect him from the evil eye."

**Question**: What is the ruling on this act?

**Answer**: ❌ This is minor shirk (forbidden amulets), and it can reach major shirk if one believes it benefits by itself.

✅ **The Correct View**: The legitimate ruqyah with Quran and adhkar, and placing trust in Allah alone.

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Indeed, ruqyah (incantations), amulets, and tiwalah (love charms) are shirk."** (Ahmad, Sahih)

---

### Case 2: Swearing by Other Than Allah
**Situation**: A young man says: "By the Prophet, I didn't do this!" or "By your life, I didn't lie!"

**Question**: Is it permissible to swear by other than Allah?

**Answer**: ❌ It is not permissible to swear by other than Allah; it is minor shirk.

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Whoever swears by other than Allah has committed shirk."** (Ahmad, Sahih)

✅ **The Correct View**: Swearing only by Allah: "Wallahi," "Billahi," "Tallahi."

---

### Case 3: Invoking the Dead
**Situation**: A man goes to the grave of a righteous saint and says: "O my master! Heal my sick son!"

**Question**: What is the ruling on this act?

**Answer**: ❌ This is **major shirk** that takes one out of the fold of Islam! Supplication is worship and is only directed to Allah.

✅ **The Correct View**: To invoke Allah alone: "O Allah, heal my son!"

﴿وَأَنَّ الْمَسَاجِدَ لِلَّهِ فَلَا تَدْعُوا مَعَ اللَّهِ أَحَدًا﴾ *"And the mosques are for Allah, so do not invoke anyone along with Allah."* (Al-Jinn 72:18)

---

### Case 4: Sacrifice at the Threshold
**Situation**: A man slaughters an animal at the threshold of his new home "to protect it from jinn and evil."

**Question**: What is the ruling on this?

**Answer**: ❌ If slaughtered seeking nearness to jinn = **major shirk**.

✅ **The Correct View**: It is slaughtered for Allah in gratitude for the new home and distributed to the poor.

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Allah has cursed whoever sacrifices for other than Allah."** (Muslim)

---

### Case 5: Showing Off in Worship
**Situation**: A young man prolongs his prayer in front of people to be called "pious and devout," but shortens it when praying alone.

**Question**: What is the danger of this?

**Answer**: ❌ This is **riya (showing off)**, a hidden form of shirk that nullifies the deed!

The Prophet ﷺ said in the Hadith Qudsi: **"I am the most self-sufficient of partners from shirk. Whoever does an action in which he associates others with Me, I will abandon him and his shirk."** (Muslim)

✅ **The Correct View**: Sincerity to Allah in private and in public.

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

**A Question to Ponder**:
> If you were alone in a dark room, no human can see you... would your worship change? Is your prayer in private like your prayer in front of people?
>
> If the answer is: Yes, it changes... this is a dangerous indicator of a deficiency in sincerity!

**Remember**:
- Allah sees you when you stand and when you prostrate
- ﴿يَعْلَمُ خَائِنَةَ الْأَعْيُنِ وَمَا تُخْفِي الصُّدُورُ﴾ *"He knows the treachery of the eyes and what the breasts conceal."* (Ghafir 40:19)
- Sincerity means your private and public life are the same
- Al-Fudayl ibn 'Iyad said: **"Leaving an action for the sake of people is showing off, and doing an action for the sake of people is shirk. Sincerity is that Allah frees you from both."**
