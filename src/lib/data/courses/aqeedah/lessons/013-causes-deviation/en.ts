## 🎬 Prologue: The Traps on the Path

<div class="scene-box">

**🛤️ THE PATH AND ITS DETOURS**

*The Prophet ﷺ once drew a straight line on the ground, then drew lines on either side of it.*

*He said, pointing to the middle line:*

> **"هَذَا سَبِيلُ اللَّهِ"** — *"This is the path of Allah."*

*Then, pointing to the side lines:*

> **"وَهَذِهِ السُّبُلُ، عَلَى كُلِّ سَبِيلٍ مِنْهَا شَيْطَانٌ يَدْعُو إِلَيْهِ"**
> *"And these are the paths. On each path, there is a devil calling to it."*
> (Reported by Ahmad, authenticated by Al-Albani)

*Allah ﷻ says:*

> **﴿وَأَنَّ هَٰذَا صِرَاطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ ۖ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ﴾**
> *"And this is My path, which is straight, so follow it; and do not follow other ways, for you will be separated from His way."* [Al-An'ām: 153]

**Knowing the causes of deviation = Protecting your faith.**

## 1️⃣ Ignorance (الجهل) — The Mother of All Deviations

### 🚨 Danger #1

<div class="scene-box">

**📕 THE PROPHECY OF THE PROPHET ﷺ**

*The Prophet ﷺ warned of a dark future:*

> **"إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَقْبِضُ الْعِلْمَ انْتِزَاعًا يَنْتَزِعُهُ مِنَ الْعِبَادِ، وَلَكِنْ يَقْبِضُ الْعِلْمَ بِقَبْضِ الْعُلَمَاءِ، حَتَّى إِذَا لَمْ يُبْقِ عَالِمٌ، اتَّخَذَ النَّاسُ رُؤُوسًا جُهَّالًا، فَسُئِلُوا فَأَفْتَوْا بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ، فَضَلُّوا وَأَضَلُّوا"**

*"Indeed, Allah does not take away knowledge by snatching it from the servants, but He takes away knowledge by taking away the scholars. Until, when no scholar remains, people take ignorant leaders. They are asked and give verdicts without knowledge, so **they go astray and lead others astray**."*
> (Sahih Bukhari 100, Sahih Muslim 2673)

*This is the catastrophic scenario: the blind leading the blind.*
