## Introduction

Deviation from authentic creed is an ancient phenomenon, against which Allah and His Messenger have warned. Knowing the causes of deviation helps in guarding against it.

Allah ﷻ says:

> "And this is My path, which is straight, so follow it; and do not follow other ways, for you will be separated from His way." (Al-An'am 6:153)

---

## First: Ignorance

### The most dangerous cause of deviation

Ignorance of the Book, the Sunnah, and the methodology of the Salaf is the most dangerous cause of misguidance.

### Proof

> "Say: 'Are those who know equal to those who do not know?'" (Az-Zumar 39:9)

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **"Indeed, Allah does not take away knowledge by snatching it from the servants, but He takes away knowledge by taking away the scholars. Until, when no scholar remains, people take ignorant leaders. They are asked and give verdicts without knowledge, so they go astray and lead others astray."**
> (Sahih Bukhari 100, Sahih Muslim 2673)

### Types of ignorance

1. **Simple ignorance**: Lack of knowledge
2. **Compound ignorance**: Ignorance with the illusion of knowledge (the most dangerous!)

### The remedy

- Seeking religious knowledge
- Returning to righteous scholars
- Humility and acknowledging one's ignorance

## Second: Following Desires

### Meaning

Giving precedence to the soul's desires over Allah's and His Messenger's commands.

### Proofs

> "Have you seen he who has taken as his god his own desire, and Allah has sent him astray due to knowledge and has set a seal upon his hearing and his heart and put over his vision a veil?" (Al-Jathiya 45:23)

> "And do not follow desire, for it will lead you astray from the way of Allah." (Sad 38:26)

### Manifestations of following desires

1. Rejecting texts with reason or taste
2. Interpreting texts to match desires
3. Picking from religion what suits
4. Abandoning the truth because it contradicts customs

### The remedy

Omar ibn al-Khattab رضي الله عنه said:

> **"Hold yourselves accountable before you are held accountable."**

## Third: Blind Imitation

### Meaning

Following ancestors and scholars without proof or insight.

### Proofs

> "And when it is said to them: 'Follow what Allah has revealed,' they say: 'Rather, we will follow that upon which we found our fathers.' Even though their fathers understood nothing, nor were they guided?" (Al-Baqara 2:170)

> "We found our fathers upon a religion, and we are following in their footsteps." (Az-Zukhruf 43:23)

### Types of imitation

| Type | Ruling |
|------|--------|
| Imitating a scholar in what one doesn't know | Permissible |
| Imitating without proof while able to know | Blameworthy |
| Imitating in contradiction to explicit text | Forbidden |

### The remedy

- Asking for proof
- Not being fanatical toward individuals
- The truth is more worthy of being followed
