<div class="scene-box">

## The Day the Prophet ﷺ Saw Jibril in His True Form

It was the night of the heavenly journey. The Prophet ﷺ raised his eyes to the sky and saw a creature of indescribable majesty: **Jibril**, in his original form, with **six hundred wings**, each so immense that it covered the horizon.

The Prophet ﷺ later described:

> *"I saw him descending from the heavens, his great size filling the space between the sky and the earth."*

At that moment, Muhammad ﷺ understood that the unseen world is filled with magnificent creatures, created from pure light, who never cease glorifying their Lord...

**And you—do you know who these beings are that surround you at every moment, recording your words and deeds?**

## 🛡️ Refutation of Doubts (الشُّبُهات والرد عليها)

### First Doubt: "Angels are myths or symbols"

**❌ The Doubt:** Some say: "Angels are symbols of the forces of good, not real creatures!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **The Quran describes them with precision:**
   > ﴿الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ فَاطِرِ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ جَاعِلِ الْمَلَائِكَةِ رُسُلًا أُولِي أَجْنِحَةٍ مَّثْنَىٰ وَثُلَاثَ وَرُبَاعَ﴾
   > "All praise is due to Allah, Creator of the heavens and the earth, who made the angels messengers having wings, two or three or four." [Fatir: 1]
   
   These are creatures with wings, not symbols!

2. **The Prophet ﷺ saw them:**
   He saw Jibrîl عليه السلام in his true form, with 600 wings covering the horizon.

3. **The consensus of the Ummah:**
   All scholars are unanimous on the real existence of angels.

### Second Doubt: "How can angels write all our deeds?"

**❌ The Doubt:** "It's impossible for angels to write all the deeds of billions of humans!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Nothing is difficult for Allah:**
   The One who created the universe can assign angels to every human being.

2. **Angels are very numerous:**
   > **«يَدْخُلُ الْبَيْتَ الْمَعْمُورَ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفَ مَلَكٍ»**
   > "70,000 angels enter Al-Bayt Al-Ma'mur every day and never return to it." (Al-Bukhari 3207)

3. **We see similar examples:**
   Computers can record billions of data. Allah creates what He wills!

---

### Third Doubt: "Why believe in invisible beings?"

**❌ The Doubt:** "I only believe in what I see! How can I believe in angels without seeing them?"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **We believe in many invisible things:**
   Electricity, radio waves, viruses... We believe in their existence through their effects.

2. **The information comes from a reliable source:**
   Allah has informed us, and He is the Absolute Truth.

3. **The Prophet ﷺ saw them:**
   He saw Jibrîl on multiple occasions and transmitted the information to us.

### Fourth Doubt: "Angels and jinn are the same thing"

**❌ The Doubt:** "Angels and jinn are synonyms for the same creatures!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Their creation is different:**
   - Angels are created from light
   - Jinn are created from fire

2. **Their nature is different:**
   - Angels have no free will to disobey
   - Jinn have the choice between good and evil

3. **The Quran distinguishes them:**
   > ﴿وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ اسْجُدُوا لِآدَمَ فَسَجَدُوا إِلَّا إِبْلِيسَ كَانَ مِنَ الْجِنِّ﴾
