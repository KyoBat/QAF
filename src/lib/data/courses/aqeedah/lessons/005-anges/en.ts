<div class="scene-box">

**🌟 The Night of Al-Isra: When the Prophet ﷺ Saw Jibril**

*The night journey to Jerusalem, then the ascension through the heavens...*

*The Prophet ﷺ raises his eyes... and there he is: **Jibril**, in his true form.*

*Not a man in white clothes. Not a messenger in human form.*

*But a being with **six hundred wings**—each wing covering the entire horizon...*

**The Prophet ﷺ:** *(describing what he saw)*

> « **I saw him descending from the heavens, his immense size filling the space between the sky and the earth.** »

*(Sahih Muslim 177)*

*At that moment, Muhammad ﷺ understood: the unseen world is filled with magnificent creatures, created from pure light, who never cease glorifying their Lord...*

*And you—do you know who these beings are that surround you **at every moment**, recording your every word and deed?*

</div>

> Belief in the angels is the **second pillar** of the six pillars of faith.

## 🛡️ Refutations of Doubts

### Doubt 1: "Angels are just symbols"

| Claim | Refutation |
|-------|------------|
| "They're not real" | The Quran describes them with wings, form, size |
| "Just metaphors for good" | The Prophet ﷺ **saw** Jibril with 600 wings |
| "No evidence" | Ijma' of the Ummah on their real existence |

### Doubt 2: "How can they record everyone?"

**Answer:** Allah created 70,000 angels entering Al-Bayt Al-Ma'mur *daily*—never returning! Their number is beyond count. Recording all humans is easy for them.

## 🛡️ Refutation of Doubts

**❌ The Doubt:** "Angels and jinn are synonyms for the same creatures!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

   - Jinn are created from fire

2. **Their nature is different:**
   - Angels have no free will to disobey
   - Jinn have the choice between good and evil

3. **The Quran distinguishes them:**
   > ﴿وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ اسْجُدُوا لِآدَمَ فَسَجَدُوا إِلَّا إِبْلِيسَ كَانَ مِنَ الْجِنِّ﴾
   > "And when We said to the angels, 'Prostrate to Adam,' they prostrated, except Iblis. He was of the jinn." [Al-Kahf: 50]

> "I saw Jibrîl in his original form twice; he had 600 wings that covered the horizon." (Al-Bukhari 3232, Muslim 177)

> "The Angel of Death came to Moses and said: 'Respond to your Lord!' Moses struck the eye of the Angel and put it out." (Al-Bukhari 1339, Muslim 2372)

Moses didn't know he was an angel! Allah restored his eye and gave him a choice.
