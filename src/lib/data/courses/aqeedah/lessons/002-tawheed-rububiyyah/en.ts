## The Oneness of Allah in His Lordship

<div class="scene-box">

**🌌 PROLOGUE: The Moment the Heart Trembled**

*Year 2 of Hijrah. Jubayer ibn Mut'im comes to Madinah to negotiate the release of prisoners from Badr. He was still a polytheist.*

*It's Maghrib time. The Prophet ﷺ is leading the prayer in the mosque. Jubayer stands apart, listening...*

*The Prophet ﷺ recites Surah At-Tur, until he reaches:*

> ﶾأَمْ خُلِقوا مِنْ غَيْرِ شَيْءٍ أَمْ هُمُ الْخَالِقونَ ’ أَمْ خَلَقوا السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ ۛ بَل لَّا يوقِنونَﶽ
> *"Or were they created by nothing, or were they the creators? Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Rather, they are not certain."*

*Jubayer later said:* **"My heart almost flew away! That was the first moment faith settled in my heart."**

*(Sahih Al-Bukhari 4854)*

## 🌟 Introduction: An Invitation to Reflect

Look around you... The sun that rises every morning with absolute precision, the stars that illuminate the night in perfect order, your heart beating right now - **60 to 100 beats per minute** - without you even thinking about it.

Who created all of this? Who commands the sun to rise in the east? Who keeps the planets in their orbits? Who circulates the blood through your veins?

It is **Allah, the Lord of all worlds** (الرب - Ar-Rabb).

---

## 📖 Definition

### Linguistic Meaning
The word **"الرب" (Ar-Rabb)** comes from the Arabic root "ر-ب-ب" which means: **the master, the nurturer, the one who takes care, the one who causes growth and brings to perfection**.

### Religious Meaning
**Tawheed Al-Rububiyyah**: It is the affirmation that Allah ﷻ is **the Only**:
- 🌌 **Creator** of all things
- 🍃 **Provider** for all creation
- 👑 **Sovereign** of the entire universe
- ⚙️ **Manager** of all affairs

> **Ibn Taymiyyah** رحمه الله said: *"Tawheed Ar-Rububiyyah is to affirm that Allah is the Lord of all things, their Creator, their Provider, the One who gives life and death, the Master of benefit and harm."*

---

## 🏛️ The Four Pillars of Rububiyyah

### 1️⃣ الخَلْق - Creation

Allah is the **only Creator** of all things, from the greatest to the smallest.

> اللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ ۖ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَكِيلٌ
>
> *"Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is, over all things, Disposer of affairs."* (Az-Zumar 39:62)

> أَمْ خُلِقُوا مِنْ غَيْرِ شَيْءٍ أَمْ هُمُ الْخَالِقُونَ ۝ أَمْ خَلَقُوا السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ ۚ بَل لَّا يُوقِنُونَ
>
> *"Or were they created by nothing, or were they the creators [of themselves]? Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Rather, they are not certain."* (At-Tur 52:35-36)

**🔬 Scientific Reflection:**

<div class="scene-box">

**🧬 THE MIRACLE OF CREATION**

The human body contains approximately **37 trillion cells**, each functioning with staggering complexity.

| Element | Quantity | Function |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Cells | 37 trillion | Units of life |
| DNA (base pairs) | 3 billion | Genetic code |
| Heartbeats/day | ~100,000 | Blood pumping |
| Neurons | 86 billion | Thought and memory |

**Who created this marvel? Who programmed the DNA with such precision?**

</div>

---

### 2️⃣ الرِّزْق - Provision

Allah is the **only Provider** for all creation.

> إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الرَّزَّاقُ ذُو الْقُوَّةِ الْمَتِينُ
>
> *"Indeed, it is Allah who is the [continual] Provider, the firm possessor of strength."* (Adh-Dhariyat 51:58)

> وَمَا مِن دَابَّةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ إِلَّا عَلَى اللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا وَيَعْلَمُ مُسْتَقَرَّهَا وَمُسْتَوْدَعَهَا
>
> *"And there is no creature on earth but that upon Allah is its provision, and He knows its place of dwelling and place of storage."* (Hud 11:6)

**📿 Hadith:** The Prophet ﷺ said:
> « إِنَّ أَحَدَكُمْ يُجْمَعُ خَلْقُهُ فِي بَطْنِ أُمِّهِ... ثُمَّ يُرْسَلُ إِلَيْهِ الْمَلَكُ فَيَنْفُخُ فِيهِ الرُّوحَ، وَيُؤْمَرُ بِأَرْبَعِ كَلِمَاتٍ: بِكَتْبِ رِزْقِهِ، وَأَجَلِهِ، وَعَمَلِهِ، وَشَقِيٌّ أَوْ سَعِيدٌ »
>
> *"Indeed, each of you is assembled in his mother's womb... then an angel is sent to him, who breathes the soul into him and is commanded to write four things: his provision, his lifespan, his deeds, and whether he will be wretched or blessed."* (Bukhari 3208, Muslim 2643)

---

### 3️⃣ المُلْك - Sovereignty

Allah is the **absolute King** of the entire universe.

> قُلِ اللَّهُمَّ مَالِكَ الْمُلْكِ تُؤْتِي الْمُلْكَ مَن تَشَاءُ وَتَنزِعُ الْمُلْكَ مِمَّن تَشَاءُ
>
> *"Say: 'O Allah, Owner of Sovereignty, You give sovereignty to whom You will and You take sovereignty away from whom You will.'"* (Âl-'Imrân 3:26)

> لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۖ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ ۖ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ
>
> *"His is the dominion of the heavens and earth. He gives life and causes death, and He is over all things competent."* (Al-Hadid 57:2)

---

### 4️⃣ التَّدْبِير - Management

Allah **manages** and **administers** all affairs of the universe.

> يُدَبِّرُ الْأَمْرَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ
>
> *"He arranges [each] matter from the heaven to the earth."* (As-Sajdah 32:5)

> قُلْ مَن يَرْزُقُكُم مِّنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ أَمَّن يَمْلِكُ السَّمْعَ وَالْأَبْصَارَ وَمَن يُخْرِجُ الْحَيَّ مِنَ الْمَيِّتِ وَيُخْرِجُ الْمَيِّتَ مِنَ الْحَيِّ وَمَن يُدَبِّرُ الْأَمْرَ ۚ فَسَيَقُولُونَ اللَّهُ
>
> *"Say, 'Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? Or who controls hearing and sight? And who brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living? And who arranges [every] matter?' They will say, 'Allah.'"* (Yunus 10:31)

---

## 📿 Proofs from the Sunnah

### Morning and Evening Supplication

> « اللَّهُمَّ فَاطِرَ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالأَرْضِ، عَالِمَ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَادَةِ، رَبَّ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ وَمَلِيكَهُ، أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ أَنْتَ »
>
> *"O Allah, Creator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the unseen and the seen, Lord and Sovereign of all things, I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except You."* (Muslim 2713)

### During Distress

> « لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ الْعَظِيمُ الْحَلِيمُ، لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ، لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ رَبُّ السَّمَوَاتِ وَرَبُّ الأَرْضِ رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْكَرِيمِ »
>
> *"There is no deity except Allah, the Most Great, the Forbearing. There is no deity except Allah, Lord of the Magnificent Throne. There is no deity except Allah, Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth, Lord of the Noble Throne."* (Bukhari 6346, Muslim 2730)

---

## ⚠️ Important Warning

### The Polytheists Acknowledged Tawheed Ar-Rububiyyah!

Even the Quraysh, despite their polytheism, **acknowledged** that Allah is the Creator and Provider:

> وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ
>
> *"And if you asked them, 'Who created the heavens and the earth?' they would surely say, 'Allah.'"* (Luqman 31:25)

> وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّن نَّزَّلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَحْيَا بِهِ الْأَرْضَ مِن بَعْدِ مَوْتِهَا لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ
>
> *"And if you asked them, 'Who sends down rain from the sky and gives life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness?' they would surely say, 'Allah.'"* (Al-'Ankabut 29:63)

**❗ Crucial Conclusion:** This acknowledgment **alone is not sufficient** to be a Muslim! One must also affirm **Tawheed Al-Uluhiyyah** (Oneness in worship) - which we will study in the next lesson.

---

## 📚 Statements of the Scholars

> **Imam Ibn Al-Qayyim** رحمه الله said:
> *"Allah's Rububiyyah entails that He is the Creator of His servants, their Provider, their Guide to what benefits them, the One who turns them away from what harms them, who nurtures and preserves them, elevates and perfects them."*

> **Sheikh Ibn Baz** رحمه الله said:
> *"Tawheed Ar-Rububiyyah is the foundation upon which Tawheed Al-Uluhiyyah is built. Whoever acknowledges that Allah is the Creator and Provider must logically devote worship exclusively to Him."*

## 🛡️ Refutation of Doubts (الشُّبُهات والرد عليها)

### First Doubt: "Nature creates and manages everything"

**❌ The Doubt:** Some atheists say: "Nature is what created the universe and life, there's no need for a creator!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Nature is a creation, not a creator!**
   > ﴿أَمْ خُلِقُوا مِنْ غَيْرِ شَيْءٍ أَمْ هُمُ الْخَالِقُونَ﴾
   > *"Or were they created by nothing, or were they the creators [of themselves]?"* (At-Tur 52:35)
   
   Who created the laws of nature themselves? Who made water boil at 100 degrees?

2. **Nature has no intelligence or will:**
   How could something without intelligence design an eye with 130 million photoreceptor cells?!

3. **Imam Ibn Al-Qayyim رحمه الله said:**
   > *"If it is said: 'It came into existence through nature', we say: 'And who brought nature into existence?' There must be a creator, and everything created must have a Creator."*

4. **Example for clarification:**
   If you found a watch in the desert, would you say: "Nature made it"? Or would you understand it has a maker? Then what about this complex universe?!

---

### Second Doubt: "The universe came about by chance"

**❌ The Doubt:** Some claim the universe appeared by chance without a creator!

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Chance does not produce order:**
   > ﴿صُنْعَ اللَّهِ الَّذِي أَتْقَنَ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ﴾
   > *"[It is] the work of Allah, who perfected all things."* (An-Naml 27:88)
   
   Can chance perfect anything?! Can randomness produce perfection?!

2. **Mathematically impossible probabilities:**
   Scientists say: the probability of a single cell forming by chance = 1 in 10 to the power of 40,000!
   This number is greater than the number of atoms in the universe!

3. **Imam Abu Hanifa رحمه الله** said to someone who asked about Allah's existence:
   > *"A ship loaded with goods sails the sea and returns by itself without a captain, is this possible?" He said: "No." He replied: "Then how could this universe exist without a Manager?!"*

4. **The Bedouin with his natural instinct said:**
   > *"Camel droppings indicate a camel, footprints indicate a traveler. A sky with constellations, an earth with pathways, seas with waves - don't these indicate the Subtle, the All-Aware?!"*

---

### Third Doubt: "Evolution explains life"

**❌ The Doubt:** Some say: "The theory of evolution explains life without the need for a creator!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Evolution - even if true - describes how, not who:**
   Even if living beings evolved, who created the first cell? Who established the laws of evolution themselves?

2. **Creation remains a reality:**
   > ﴿وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا الْإِنسَانَ مِن سُلَالَةٍ مِّن طِينٍ﴾
   > *"And certainly did We create man from an extract of clay."* (Al-Mu'minun 23:12)

3. **Sheikh Ibn Uthaymin رحمه الله said:**
   > *"Even if we assumed that humans evolved from another creature, who created that creature? There must be a Creator at the beginning."*

4. **Miracles break natural laws:**
   Adam عليه السلام was created from clay without father or mother, and Isa عليه السلام was created from a mother without a father.
   > ﴿إِنَّ مَثَلَ عِيسَىٰ عِندَ اللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ آدَمَ ۖ خَلَقَهُ مِن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ﴾
   > *"Indeed, the example of Jesus to Allah is like that of Adam. He created Him from dust; then He said to him, 'Be,' and he was."* (Al-Imran 3:59)

---

### Fourth Doubt: "Evil in the world contradicts the existence of a merciful God"

**❌ The Doubt:** "If God existed and was merciful, why is there disease, poverty, and injustice?"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **This world is an abode of trial, not reward:**
   > ﴿الَّذِي خَلَقَ الْمَوْتَ وَالْحَيَاةَ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًا﴾
   > *"[He] who created death and life to test you [as to] which of you is best in deed."* (Al-Mulk 67:2)

2. **Wisdom may be hidden from us:**
   > ﴿وَعَسَىٰ أَن تَكْرَهُوا شَيْئًا وَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ﴾
   > *"Perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you."* (Al-Baqarah 2:216)
   
   The sick person may have their sins expiated, the poor person may be elevated in rank.

3. **Evil is relative:**
   What you see as evil may be good in Allah's knowledge.

4. **Recompense is in the Hereafter:**
   > ﴿وَلَا تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ غَافِلًا عَمَّا يَعْمَلُ الظَّالِمُونَ﴾
   > *"And never think that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do."* (Ibrahim 14:42)

5. **Imam Ibn Al-Qayyim رحمه الله said:**
   > *"Allah has perfect wisdom in what He decrees and predestines, even if it is hidden from His servants."*

---

### Fifth Doubt: "Modern science replaces faith"

**❌ The Doubt:** "Science has discovered everything, we don't need to believe in the unseen!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Science proves the Creator's existence, it doesn't negate it:**
   Every scientific discovery reveals the greatness of the Creator!
   
   Allah says:
   > ﴿سَنُرِيهِمْ آيَاتِنَا فِي الْآفَاقِ وَفِي أَنفُسِهِمْ حَتَّىٰ يَتَبَيَّنَ لَهُمْ أَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ﴾
   > *"We will show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth."* (Fussilat 41:53)

2. **The greatest scientists believed in God:**
   - Newton, discoverer of gravity, was a believer
   - Einstein said: "Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind" *(Note: Einstein was a deist, not a monotheist in the Islamic sense)*
   - Francis Collins (leader of the Human Genome Project) is a believer

3. **Science is limited:**
   Science answers "how" but not "why".
   Science cannot study what came before the universe or what follows death.

4. **Sheikh Ibn Baz رحمه الله said:**
   > *"Every true scientific discovery increases the believer's faith in Allah's greatness and power."*

## 📜 Stories and Traditions on Tawheed Ar-Rububiyyah

### The Story of Imam Abu Hanifa with the Atheists

<div class="scene-box">

A group of deniers of the Creator (the Dahriyyah) came to debate with Imam Abu Hanifa...

The Imam told them: **"Let me think about something I was told!"**

They asked: "What is it?"

He said: **"They told me about a ship at sea, loaded with goods, that goes and comes, docks at ports, unloads its cargo and loads another... all without a captain to steer it!"**

They said: **"That's impossible! No sane person would say that!"**

The Imam then said: **"SubhanAllah! A ship cannot sail without a captain, yet this magnificent universe with its heavens, earth, seas, and mountains operates without a Manager?!"**

They were stunned, and some of them embraced Islam.

</div>

### The Story of the Bedouin and the Natural Instinct (Fitrah)

<div class="scene-box">

A Bedouin was asked: **"How did you come to know your Lord?"**

He answered: **"Camel droppings indicate a camel, footprints indicate a traveler. A sky with constellations, an earth with pathways, seas with waves - don't these indicate the Subtle, the All-Aware?!"**

</div>

### The Story of Al-Ma'mun and the Christian Physician

<div class="scene-box">

Caliph Al-Ma'mun had a Christian physician. Imam Ali Al-Rida debated with him about the existence of the Creator...

He said to him: **"Tell me, if this world had no manager and no creator, where would these creatures come from? And who makes these celestial bodies rotate?"**

The physician replied: "SubhanAllah! This can only come from a Wise Creator!"

</div>

---

## 💎 Statements of Scholars on Tawheed Ar-Rububiyyah

### Imam Ibn Kathir رحمه الله

> *"Tawheed Ar-Rububiyyah is what Allah created His creation upon naturally (Fitrah). That is why only outliers denied it, like Pharaoh who said: 'I know of no god for you other than myself', while deep inside himself he knew that Allah is the Creator."*

---

### Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah رحمه الله

> *"Acknowledgment of Lordship (Rububiyyah) is not sufficient to enter Islam, otherwise the polytheists would have been Muslims! For they acknowledged that Allah is the Creator, the Provider, the One who gives life and death."*

---

### Sheikh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab رحمه الله

> *"Tawheed Ar-Rububiyyah is a proof against the servants. Whoever acknowledges that Allah created him and provided for him must worship Him alone without any partner."*

---

### Sheikh As-Sa'di رحمه الله

> *"Whoever contemplates this universe and the perfection and precision it contains will know with certainty that it has a Lord who is Wise, All-Knowing, and All-Powerful."*

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf: Abdullah ibn Al-Mubarak and the Sound Fitrah

<div class="story-box">

**In the 2nd century of Hijrah**, a man came to Imam Abdullah ibn Al-Mubarak رحمه الله complaining about his condition...

The man said: **"O Imam, I find in myself doubts that make me question the existence of Allah!"**

Ibn Al-Mubarak was silent for a moment, then said: **"Tell me, if you were in a desert, lost your way, ran out of water and provisions, then saw a caravan coming from afar... would you be happy or sad?"**

He said: Happy, of course!

He said: **"And why would you be happy?"**

He said: Because they would rescue me!

Ibn Al-Mubarak said: **"Then you know in your fitrah (natural instinct) that there is someone who can benefit or harm you! And this is the meaning of Lordship. The One who truly possesses the power to benefit and harm you is Allah alone!"**

The man's doubts disappeared.

</div>

**📌 The Lesson**: The sound fitrah testifies to Tawheed Ar-Rububiyyah; it is only obscured by doubts and desires. Whoever returns to their fitrah will find Allah.

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases: Tawheed Ar-Rububiyyah in Our Lives

### Case 1: The Student and the Exam
**Situation**: A student preparing for a crucial exam says to his friend: "If I pass, it's only because of my effort and intelligence!"

**Question**: Is this statement correct?

**Answer**: ❌ This reflects a deficiency in understanding Tawheed Ar-Rububiyyah. Success is in Allah's Hands, even though effort is required.

✅ **The Correct View**: "I strive and place my trust in Allah, for He is the One who grants success and guidance."

Allah says: ﴿وَمَا تَوْفِيقِي إِلَّا بِاللَّهِ﴾ *"And my success is only through Allah."* (Hud 11:88)

---

### Case 2: The Patient and the Doctor
**Situation**: A patient says: "Doctor so-and-so is the one who healed me!"

**Question**: What is wrong with this statement?

**Answer**: ❌ Attributing healing solely to the doctor is a doctrinal error.

✅ **The Correct View**: "Allah healed me, and the doctor was a means." The doctor treats, but Allah heals.

Ibrahim عليه السلام said: ﴿وَإِذَا مَرِضْتُ فَهُوَ يَشْفِينِ﴾ *"And when I am ill, it is He who heals me."* (Ash-Shu'ara 26:80)

---

### Case 3: The Merchant and Provision
**Situation**: A merchant says: "I built my wealth myself; this money is from my own sweat!"

**Question**: Is this statement acceptable according to Sharia?

**Answer**: ❌ This is similar to what Qarun said: ﴿إِنَّمَا أُوتِيتُهُ عَلَىٰ عِلْمٍ عِندِي﴾ *"I was only given it because of knowledge I have."* (Al-Qasas 28:78)

✅ **The Correct View**: "Allah provided for me, and I exerted the means." The Provider is Allah alone.

---

### Case 4: The Atheist and the Universe
**Situation**: Someone says: "The universe came into existence by chance over millions of years; there's no need for the concept of a Creator!"

**Question**: How do we refute this doubt?

**Answer**:
- Chance does not produce a precise system
- Every existing thing must have a cause for its existence
- ﴿أَمْ خُلِقُوا مِنْ غَيْرِ شَيْءٍ أَمْ هُمُ الْخَالِقُونَ﴾ *"Or were they created by nothing, or were they the creators?"* (At-Tur 52:35)
- If you found a watch in the desert, would you say "it came by chance"? Then what about this complex universe!

---

### Case 5: The Child and the Instinctive Question
**Situation**: A child asks their mother: "Mom, who created the sky, the sun, and the moon?"

**Question**: What does this question indicate?

**Answer**: ✅ This is evidence of the fitrah! The child instinctively knows that every creation has a Creator.

**The Correct Answer for the Mother**: "Allah, my child. He is the One who created everything, and He is the One who provides for us and protects us."

---

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

**A Question to Ponder**:
> Look now at your hand... Who designed these five fingers? Who placed joints in them that move with such precision? Who gave them the strength to grasp, write, and work?
>
> If all the scientists on earth gathered together, could they create a single hand that works like yours?!

**Remember**:
- You are a creation of a Great Creator
- Every blessing in you is from Allah
- Acknowledging Lordship necessitates worship
- ﴿أَلَا لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالْأَمْرُ تَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَالَمِينَ﴾ *"Unquestionably, His is the creation and the command; blessed is Allah, Lord of the worlds."* (Al-A'raf 7:54)

---

## 🤲 Supplication

> O Allah, our Lord, to You belongs all praise. You are the Sustainer of the heavens and the earth and all that is in them.
> O Allah, to You belongs all praise. You are the Light of the heavens and the earth and all that is in them.
> O Allah, to You belongs all praise. You are the King of the heavens and the earth and all that is in them.
> (From the supplication of the Prophet ﷺ - Sahih Al-Bukhari 1120)

Rabbi Zidni 'Ilma. 📖`
