**🌙 PROLOGUE: The Question to Imam Malik**

*Madinah, 2nd century of Hijrah. Imam Malik ibn Anas رحمه الله is sitting in the Prophet's mosque ﷺ, surrounded by his students.*

*A man enters and asks a delicate question...*

**🗣️ The man:** "O Abu 'Abdillah! Allah says: 'The Most Merciful rose over the Throne.' **How** did He rise?"

*Imam Malik lowered his head. Sweat beaded on his forehead. Silence fell.*

*Then he raised his head and said:*

**🔵 Imam Malik:** **"The rising (istiwaa) is known, the 'how' is unknown, belief in it is obligatory, and asking about it is an innovation. And I do not see you except as an innovator!"**

*Then he ordered that the man be removed.*

This answer became the golden rule for the Salaf's methodology concerning Allah's Names and Attributes.

</div>

## 🔍 Definition

It is to affirm for Allah what He has affirmed for Himself in His Book or what His Messenger ﷺ has affirmed for Him, regarding His Names and Attributes, without:
- **Tahreef** (تحريف): Distorting the meaning
- **Ta'til** (تعطيل): Denying the attributes
- **Takyif** (تكييف): Asking "how?"
- **Tamthil** (تمثيل): Likening to creation

## The Fundamental Principle

Allah ﷻ says:

> "There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing." (Ash-Shura 42:11)

This verse contains two principles:
1. **Negation of resemblance**: "There is nothing like unto Him"
2. **Affirmation of Attributes**: "He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing"

## The Attributes of Allah (As-Sifat)

### 1️⃣ The Attribute of Hearing (As-Sam')

> "Indeed, Allah is All-Hearing and All-Seeing." (An-Nisa 4:58)

> "Certainly has Allah heard the speech of the one who argues with you concerning her husband." (Al-Mujadila 58:1)

**Explanation**: Allah hears all voices, whether secret or public, near or far. His hearing encompasses everything without any limitation.

### 2️⃣ The Attribute of Sight (Al-Basar)

> "And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do." (Al-Hujurat 49:18)

> "Who sees you when you arise. And your movement among those who prostrate." (Ash-Shu'ara 26:218-219)

**Explanation**: Allah sees everything; nothing escapes Him, even in the deepest darkness.

### 3️⃣ The Attribute of Speech (Al-Kalam)

> "And Allah spoke to Moses with direct speech." (An-Nisa 4:164)

> "And if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that he may hear the words of Allah." (At-Tawbah 9:6)

**Explanation**: Allah truly speaks with words and letters. The Quran is the speech of Allah, uncreated.

### 4️⃣ The Attribute of Two Hands (Al-Yadayn)

> "Allah said: 'O Iblis, what prevented you from prostrating to that which I created with My Two Hands?'" (Sad 38:75)

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> "The Right Hand of Allah is full; spending does not diminish it." (Sahih Al-Bukhari 7411)

**Explanation**: We affirm for Allah Two Hands that befit His Majesty, without any resemblance to the hands of creation.

### 5️⃣ The Attribute of the Face (Al-Wajh)

> "And the Face of your Lord will remain, Owner of Majesty and Honor." (Ar-Rahman 55:27)

> "The Most Merciful rose over the Throne." (Ta-Ha 20:5)

> "Do you feel secure that He who is above the heaven would not cause the earth to swallow you?" (Al-Mulk 67:16)

The Prophet ﷺ asked a slave girl:

> "'Where is Allah?' She said: 'Above the heaven.' He said: 'Who am I?' She said: 'You are the Messenger of Allah.' He said: 'Free her, for she is a believer.'" (Sahih Muslim 537)

**Explanation**: Allah is above His creation, established upon His Throne, in a manner that befits His Majesty.

## Rules Concerning the Names and Attributes

### Rule 1: Allah's Names are all beautiful

> "And to Allah belong the Most Beautiful Names." (Al-A'raf 7:180)

All of Allah's Names indicate absolute perfection.

### Rule 2: Allah's Names are tawqifiyya (based on texts)

We can only name Allah by what He has named Himself or by what His Messenger ﷺ has named Him.

### Rule 3: Each Name implies an Attribute

The Name "As-Sami'" (the All-Hearing) implies the Attribute of Hearing (As-Sam').
The Name "Al-'Alim" (the All-Knowing) implies the Attribute of Knowledge (Al-'Ilm).

### Rule 4: Attributes are of two types

1. **Affirmative attributes (Sifat thubutiyya)**: What Allah has affirmed for Himself (Knowledge, Power, Life, etc.)
2. **Negative attributes (Sifat salbiyya)**: What Allah has negated from Himself (injustice, fatigue, sleep, etc.)

## The Methodology of the Salaf

Imam Malik رحمه الله said when asked about how Allah rose over the Throne:

> "The rising (istiwaa) is known, the 'how' is unknown, belief in it is obligatory, and asking about it is an innovation."

This statement summarizes the methodology of the pious predecessors:
- **Affirm** what Allah has affirmed for Himself
- **Negate** what Allah has negated from Himself
- **Do not delve** into the "how"
- **Do not liken** to creation

---

## 🛡️ Refutation of Doubts (الشُّبُهات والرد عليها)

### First Doubt: "Affirming Attributes implies anthropomorphism"

**❌ The Doubt:** Some say: "If we affirm that Allah has Hands, a Face, and Eyes, we have likened Him to creatures!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Sharing a name does not mean sharing the reality:**
   Man has a hand, an ant has a hand, an elephant has a trunk called "hand"... Are they identical? No!
   So what about the Attributes of the Creator and the creature?!

2. **The golden rule:**
   > ﴿لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ ۖ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ﴾
   > "There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing." [Ash-Shura: 11]
   
   Allah affirmed Hearing and Sight for Himself while negating any resemblance.

3. **Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah رحمه الله said:**
   > *"The statement concerning the Attributes is like the statement concerning the Essence. Just as Allah has an Essence that resembles no other essence, He has Attributes that resemble no other attribute."*

---

### Second Doubt: "Establishment on the Throne implies place and direction"

**❌ The Doubt:** "If you say Allah is above the Throne, you have limited Him to a place and direction!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Allah is Greater than being contained by anything:**
   > ﴿وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ﴾
   > "His Kursî extends over the heavens and the earth." [Al-Baqarah: 255]

2. **Elevation is perfection:**
   Elevation in all human languages is a perfection, and Allah is described by every perfection.

3. **The texts are explicit:**
   > ﴿أَأَمِنتُم مَّن فِي السَّمَاءِ﴾ [Al-Mulk: 16]
   > ﴿يَخَافُونَ رَبَّهُم مِّن فَوْقِهِمْ﴾ [An-Nahl: 50]

4. **Imam Adh-Dhahabi رحمه الله said:**
   > *"The hadiths about elevation are mutawâtir (mass-transmitted), and believing in them is the consensus of the Salaf."*

---

### Third Doubt: "Allah's Attributes are metaphors"

**❌ The Doubt:** "The Hand means power, the Face means the Essence, the Eye means surveillance..."

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **The origin in language is the literal meaning:**
   We do not divert a word from its apparent meaning without proof, and there is no proof here.

2. **Interpretation nullifies the meaning:**
   If Hand = power, what does ﴿خَلَقْتُ بِيَدَيَّ﴾ mean? Did He create with two powers?!
   And why did He say ﴿بِيَدَيَّ﴾ in the dual form and not "with My power"?

3. **Allah distinguishes between Attributes:**
   > ﴿وَلِتُصْنَعَ عَلَىٰ عَيْنِي﴾ [Ta-Ha: 39]
   > ﴿وَيَبْقَىٰ وَجْهُ رَبِّكَ﴾ [Ar-Rahman: 27]
   
   He distinguishes between the Eye and the Face, proving they are distinct real Attributes.

---

### Fourth Doubt: "Allah's descent implies movement"

**❌ The Doubt:** "Your claim that Allah descends every night to the lowest heaven implies movement!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **The hadith is authentic and irrefutable:**
   > **«يَنْزِلُ رَبُّنَا تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى كُلَّ لَيْلَةٍ إِلَى السَّمَاءِ الدُّنْيَا»**
   > (Sahih Al-Bukhari 1145, Sahih Muslim 758)

2. **We do not ask about the "how":**
   We affirm the descent without asking: how?
   As Malik said: "The how is unknown."

3. **His descent does not vacate the Throne:**
   His descent does not mean He leaves His Throne, for He is not like the creation.

---

### Fifth Doubt: "Allah's speech is eternal and does not renew"

**❌ The Doubt:** "Allah does not speak according to His will; His speech is eternal and ancient!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Allah speaks when He wills, about what He wills:**
   > ﴿إِنَّمَا أَمْرُهُ إِذَا أَرَادَ شَيْئًا أَن يَقُولَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ﴾ [Ya-Sin: 82]

2. **He spoke to Moses at a specific time:**
   > ﴿وَكَلَّمَ اللَّهُ مُوسَىٰ تَكْلِيمًا﴾ [An-Nisa: 164]
   
   The past tense verb indicates He spoke to him at a particular moment.

3. **Imam Al-Bukhari رحمه الله said:**
   > *"Allah speaks with letters and sound."*

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf: The Patience of Imam Ahmad Against Innovation

<div class="story-box">

**During the reigns of Al-Ma'mun, Al-Mu'tasim, and Al-Wathiq**, people were forced to say that the Quran is created, and that Allah does not truly speak.

Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal رحمه الله stood alone defending the creed of the Salaf...

They said to him: **"Say the Quran is created and we will end your torture!"**

He said: **"Bring me a verse from the Book of Allah or a hadith from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ!"**

He was whipped until he fainted and imprisoned for thirty months...

When asked: What kept you firm?

He said: **"I would say to myself: I may die tomorrow, but knowledge will remain. Had I said a single word contrary to the truth, I would have misled the entire Ummah!"**

He would say: **"The Quran is the speech of Allah, uncreated. From Him it originated and to Him it shall return."**

</div>

**📌 The Lesson**: Imam Ahmad remained firm in affirming the attribute of Speech for Allah as befits His Majesty, and endured harm for the sake of the correct creed. This is the methodology of the Salaf: Affirmation without resemblance, and transcendence without denial.

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases: Tawheed Al-Asma wa Sifat in Our Lives

### Case 1: The Attribute of Elevation
**Situation**: Someone says: "Allah is everywhere!" or "Allah is present with us in His Essence here!"

**Question**: Is this doctrinally correct?

**Answer**: ❌ This contradicts the creed of the Salaf. Allah **in His Essence** is above His heavens, established upon His Throne, and He is **with His Knowledge** in every place.

✅ **The Correct View**: ﴿الرَّحْمَٰنُ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ اسْتَوَىٰ﴾ *"The Most Merciful rose over the Throne."* (Ta-Ha 20:5)

The Prophet ﷺ asked the slave girl: **"Where is Allah?"** She said: Above the heaven. He said: **"Free her, for she is a believer."** (Muslim)

---

### Case 2: False Interpretation
**Situation**: Someone says: "Allah's Hand means His power, and Allah's Eye means His care, because taking them literally would mean anthropomorphism!"

**Question**: What is wrong with this statement?

**Answer**: ❌ This is **false interpretation** that negates the Attributes. Allah has a real Hand that befits His Majesty, unlike the hands of creatures.

✅ **The Correct View**: "We affirm for Allah a Hand that befits His Majesty; we do not ask 'how' and we do not liken it to the hands of creatures."

﴿لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ ۖ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ﴾ *"There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing."* (Ash-Shura 42:11)

---

### Case 3: Asking About the "How"
**Situation**: Someone asks: "How does Allah descend to the lowest heaven? Does He leave His Throne?"

**Question**: How do we answer this?

**Answer**:
✅ **The Methodology of the Salaf**: We affirm the descent as it came in the authentic hadith, and we do not ask about the "how."

Imam Malik said: **"The rising (istiwaa) is known, the how is unknown, believing in it is obligatory, and asking about it is an innovation."**

Allah descends in a manner befitting His Majesty, and what applies to the descent of a creature does not necessarily apply to His descent.

---

### Case 4: Anthropomorphism
**Situation**: Someone says: "Allah hears like our hearing, and sees like our seeing, for the attributes are the same!"

**Question**: What is wrong with this?

**Answer**: ❌ This is forbidden **anthropomorphism**! Allah's Attributes do not resemble the attributes of creatures.

✅ **The Correct View**: Allah hears with a Hearing that befits His Majesty, different from the hearing of creatures. Man has hearing and an ant has hearing, yet they are different despite the similarity in name. How then about the Attributes of the Creator!

---

### Case 5: Supplicating with the Beautiful Names
**Situation**: Someone in financial difficulty supplicates: "O Provider (Ya Razzaq), provide for me!" And another who is sick says: "O Healer (Ya Shafi), heal me!"

**Question**: Is this supplication correct?

**Answer**: ✅ Yes! This is a **recommended supplication** that is sought.

﴿وَلِلَّهِ الْأَسْمَاءُ الْحُسْنَىٰ فَادْعُوهُ بِهَا﴾ *"And to Allah belong the Most Beautiful Names, so invoke Him by them."* (Al-A'raf 7:180)

**From the Sunnah**: Seeking means to Allah through His Names and Attributes that are appropriate for what is being requested.

---

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

**A Question to Ponder**:
> Allah is "As-Sami' (the All-Hearing)"... What does it mean to know that Allah hears the whispers of your heart, your complaints in the depths of the night, and your secret supplication that your lips have not even uttered?
>
> How does this affect your relationship with Allah?

**Remember**:
- Every Name of Allah generates in your heart a form of servitude
- The Name "Ar-Raqib (the Watchful)" makes you watch over yourself
- The Name "Al-Ghafur (the Forgiving)" fills you with hope
- The Name "Al-Wadud (the Loving)" fills your heart with love for Allah
- Knowing the Names and Attributes = Knowing Allah = The Greatest Knowledge

Ibn Al-Qayyim رحمه الله said: **"Whoever knows Allah through His Names and Attributes will inevitably love Him."**

---

## 🌟 Fruits of Faith in the Names and Attributes

1. **Knowing Allah truly** — through His Names and Attributes
2. **Loving Allah** — the more you know Him, the more you love Him
3. **Balance between fear and hope** — by knowing His mercy and punishment
4. **Correct trust** — in the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, the All-Powerful
5. **Supplicating with the Most Beautiful Names** — ﴿فَادْعُوهُ بِهَا﴾
6. **Glorifying Allah** — by transcending Him above all defects

---

## Supplication

> O Allah, we ask You by every Name that belongs to You, by which You have named Yourself, or which You have revealed in Your Book, or which You have taught any of Your creation, or which You have kept in the knowledge of the Unseen, to make the Quran the spring of our hearts and the light of our chests.

O Lord, increase me in knowledge! 📖`
