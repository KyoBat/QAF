## 🔍 Definition

It is to affirm for Allah what He has affirmed for Himself in His Book or what His Messenger ﷺ has affirmed for Him, regarding His Names and Attributes, without:
- **Tahreef** (تحريف): Distorting the meaning
- **Ta'til** (تعطيل): Denying the attributes
- **Takyif** (تكييف): Asking "how?"
- **Tamthil** (تمثيل): Likening to creation

## The Fundamental Principle

Allah ﷻ says:

> "There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing." (Ash-Shura 42:11)

This verse contains two principles:
1. **Negation of resemblance**: "There is nothing like unto Him"
2. **Affirmation of Attributes**: "He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing"

## The Attributes of Allah (As-Sifat)

### 1️⃣ The Attribute of Hearing (As-Sam')

> "Indeed, Allah is All-Hearing and All-Seeing." (An-Nisa 4:58)

> "Certainly has Allah heard the speech of the one who argues with you concerning her husband." (Al-Mujadila 58:1)

**Explanation**: Allah hears all voices, whether secret or public, near or far. His hearing encompasses everything without any limitation.

### 2️⃣ The Attribute of Sight (Al-Basar)

> "And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do." (Al-Hujurat 49:18)

> "Who sees you when you arise. And your movement among those who prostrate." (Ash-Shu'ara 26:218-219)

**Explanation**: Allah sees everything; nothing escapes Him, even in the deepest darkness.

### 3️⃣ The Attribute of Speech (Al-Kalam)

> "And Allah spoke to Moses with direct speech." (An-Nisa 4:164)

> "And if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that he may hear the words of Allah." (At-Tawbah 9:6)

**Explanation**: Allah truly speaks with words and letters. The Quran is the speech of Allah, uncreated.

### 4️⃣ The Attribute of Two Hands (Al-Yadayn)

> "Allah said: 'O Iblis, what prevented you from prostrating to that which I created with My Two Hands?'" (Sad 38:75)

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> "The Right Hand of Allah is full; spending does not diminish it." (Sahih Al-Bukhari 7411)

**Explanation**: We affirm for Allah Two Hands that befit His Majesty, without any resemblance to the hands of creation.

### 5️⃣ The Attribute of the Face (Al-Wajh)

> "And the Face of your Lord will remain, Owner of Majesty and Honor." (Ar-Rahman 55:27)

> "Everything will be destroyed except His Face." (Al-Qasas 28:88)

**Explanation**: Allah possesses a Face that befits His Greatness, different from the faces of creatures.

### 6️⃣ The Attribute of Elevation (Al-'Uluw)

> "The Most Merciful rose over the Throne." (Ta-Ha 20:5)

> "Do you feel secure that He who is above the heaven would not cause the earth to swallow you?" (Al-Mulk 67:16)

The Prophet ﷺ asked a slave girl:

> "'Where is Allah?' She said: 'Above the heaven.' He said: 'Who am I?' She said: 'You are the Messenger of Allah.' He said: 'Free her, for she is a believer.'" (Sahih Muslim 537)

**Explanation**: Allah is above His creation, established upon His Throne, in a manner that befits His Majesty.

## Rules Concerning the Names and Attributes

### Rule 1: Allah's Names are all beautiful

> "And to Allah belong the Most Beautiful Names." (Al-A'raf 7:180)

All of Allah's Names indicate absolute perfection.

### Rule 2: Allah's Names are tawqifiyya (based on texts)

We can only name Allah by what He has named Himself or by what His Messenger ﷺ has named Him.

### Rule 3: Each Name implies an Attribute

The Name "As-Sami'" (the All-Hearing) implies the Attribute of Hearing (As-Sam').
The Name "Al-'Alim" (the All-Knowing) implies the Attribute of Knowledge (Al-'Ilm).

### Rule 4: Attributes are of two types

1. **Affirmative attributes (Sifat thubutiyya)**: What Allah has affirmed for Himself (Knowledge, Power, Life, etc.)
2. **Negative attributes (Sifat salbiyya)**: What Allah has negated from Himself (injustice, fatigue, sleep, etc.)

## The Methodology of the Salaf

Imam Malik رحمه الله said when asked about how Allah rose over the Throne:

> "The rising (istiwaa) is known, the 'how' is unknown, belief in it is obligatory, and asking about it is an innovation."

This statement summarizes the methodology of the pious predecessors:
- **Affirm** what Allah has affirmed for Himself
- **Negate** what Allah has negated from Himself
- **Do not delve** into the "how"
- **Do not liken** to creation

## 🛡️ Refutation of Doubts (الشُّبُهات والرد عليها)

### First Doubt: "Affirming Attributes implies anthropomorphism"

**❌ The Doubt:** Some say: "If we affirm that Allah has Hands, a Face, and Eyes, we have likened Him to creatures!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Sharing a name does not mean sharing the reality:**
   Man has a hand, an ant has a hand, an elephant has a trunk called "hand"... Are they identical? No!
   So what about the Attributes of the Creator and the creature?!

2. **The golden rule:**
   > ﴿لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ ۖ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ﴾
   > "There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing." [Ash-Shura: 11]
   
   Allah affirmed Hearing and Sight for Himself while negating any resemblance.

3. **Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah رحمه الله said:**
   > *"The statement concerning the Attributes is like the statement concerning the Essence. Just as Allah has an Essence that resembles no other essence, He has Attributes that resemble no other attribute."*

---

### Second Doubt: "Establishment on the Throne implies place and direction"

**❌ The Doubt:** "If you say Allah is above the Throne, you have limited Him to a place and direction!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Allah is Greater than being contained by anything:**
   > ﴿وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ﴾
   > "His Kursî extends over the heavens and the earth." [Al-Baqarah: 255]

2. **Elevation is perfection:**
   Elevation in all human languages is a perfection, and Allah is described by every perfection.

3. **The texts are explicit:**
   > ﴿أَأَمِنتُم مَّن فِي السَّمَاءِ﴾ [Al-Mulk: 16]
   > ﴿يَخَافُونَ رَبَّهُم مِّن فَوْقِهِمْ﴾ [An-Nahl: 50]

4. **Imam Adh-Dhahabi رحمه الله said:**
   > *"The hadiths about elevation are mutawâtir (mass-transmitted), and believing in them is the consensus of the Salaf."*

---

### Third Doubt: "Allah's Attributes are metaphors"

**❌ The Doubt:** "The Hand means power, the Face means the Essence, the Eye means surveillance..."

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **The origin in language is the literal meaning:**
   We do not divert a word from its apparent meaning without proof, and there is no proof here.

2. **Interpretation nullifies the meaning:**
   If Hand = power, what does ﴿خَلَقْتُ بِيَدَيَّ﴾ mean? Did He create with two powers?!
   And why did He say ﴿بِيَدَيَّ﴾ in the dual form and not "with My power"?

3. **Allah distinguishes between Attributes:**
   > ﴿وَلِتُصْنَعَ عَلَىٰ عَيْنِي﴾ [Ta-Ha: 39]
   > ﴿وَيَبْقَىٰ وَجْهُ رَبِّكَ﴾ [Ar-Rahman: 27]
   
   He distinguishes between the Eye and the Face, proving they are distinct real Attributes.

---

### Fourth Doubt: "Allah's descent implies movement"

**❌ The Doubt:** "Your claim that Allah descends every night to the lowest heaven implies movement!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **The hadith is authentic and irrefutable:**
   > **«يَنْزِلُ رَبُّنَا تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى كُلَّ لَيْلَةٍ إِلَى السَّمَاءِ الدُّنْيَا»**
   > (Sahih Al-Bukhari 1145, Sahih Muslim 758)

2. **We do not ask about the "how":**
   We affirm the descent without asking: how?
   As Malik said: "The how is unknown."

3. **His descent does not vacate the Throne:**
   His descent does not mean He leaves His Throne, for He is not like the creation.

---

### Fifth Doubt: "Allah's speech is eternal and does not renew"

**❌ The Doubt:** "Allah does not speak according to His will; His speech is eternal and ancient!"

**✅ The Refutation:**

1. **Allah speaks when He wills, about what He wills:**
   > ﴿إِنَّمَا أَمْرُهُ إِذَا أَرَادَ شَيْئًا أَن يَقُولَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ﴾ [Ya-Sin: 82]

2. **He spoke to Moses at a specific time:**
   > ﴿وَكَلَّمَ اللَّهُ مُوسَىٰ تَكْلِيمًا﴾ [An-Nisa: 164]
   
   The past tense verb indicates He spoke to him at a particular moment.

3. **Imam Al-Bukhari رحمه الله said:**
   > *"Allah speaks with letters and sound."*
