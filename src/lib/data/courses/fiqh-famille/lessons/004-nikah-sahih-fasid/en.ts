# Valid and Invalid Marriage

## Categories of Marriage According to Validity

Marriage is divided into three categories based on validity:

1. **Valid Marriage (Sahih)**: One that fulfills all its pillars and conditions
2. **Defective Marriage (Fasid)**: One where a condition is missing
3. **Void Marriage (Batil)**: One where a pillar is missing

## Valid Marriage

### Definition

A marriage that fulfills all its legal pillars and conditions, and is not accompanied by any impediment to its validity.

### Conditions for Marriage Validity

| Condition | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Identification of spouses | By name, description, or indication |
| Consent of both spouses | Virgin's silence is consent, non-virgin must express |
| The guardian | No marriage without guardian |
| Witnessing | Two upright witnesses |
| Absence of impediments | Kinship, breastfeeding, affinity |
| The dowry | Even if not mentioned in the contract |

### Effects of Valid Marriage

1. Permissibility of intimacy between spouses
2. Obligation of dowry for the wife
3. Obligation of maintenance and housing
4. Establishment of children's lineage
5. Establishment of inheritance between spouses
6. Prohibition through affinity

## Defective Marriage

### Definition

A marriage where a condition of validity is missing, while its pillars remain intact.

### Examples of Defective Marriage

#### 1. Shighar Marriage

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"There is no shighar in Islam"** [Reported by Muslim]

**Definition**: A man marries his daughter or sister to another on condition that the other marries his daughter or sister to him, each woman serving as the dowry for the other.

**Reason for prohibition**: Harm to the woman and deprivation of her dowry.

#### 2. Tahlil Marriage (Marriage of Legalization)

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Allah has cursed the one who makes lawful (remarriage) and the one for whom it is made lawful"** [Reported by Ahmad and Tirmidhi]

**Definition**: A man marries a woman divorced three times with the intention of making her lawful for her first husband.

**Reason for prohibition**: Circumventing divine law and using the woman as a means.

#### 3. Temporary Marriage (Mut'a)

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Allah has forbidden temporary marriage on the day of Khaybar"** [Bukhari and Muslim]

**Definition**: Marriage limited to a specific duration.

**Reason for prohibition**: Contradicts the objectives of marriage of stability and tranquility.

### Ruling on Defective Marriage

- Must be annulled immediately
- If consummation occurred:
  - Child's lineage is established
  - Equivalent dowry is due
  - Waiting period is obligatory for the woman
- Inheritance between spouses is not established

## Void Marriage

### Definition

A marriage where a pillar is missing, so it is not concluded at all.

### Examples of Void Marriage

#### 1. Marriage with Prohibited Women

Allah says: **"Prohibited to you are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters..."** [An-Nisa: 23]

#### 2. Marrying a Fifth Wife When Already Having Four

Allah says: **"Marry those that please you of women, two, three, or four"** [An-Nisa: 3]

#### 3. Marrying a Woman in Another's Waiting Period

Allah says: **"And do not resolve on the marriage contract until the decreed period reaches its end"** [Al-Baqarah: 235]

#### 4. Marriage of a Muslim Woman to a Non-Muslim

Allah says: **"And do not marry polytheistic men until they believe"** [Al-Baqarah: 221]

### Ruling on Void Marriage

- Not concluded at all
- Separation is immediately obligatory
- Intercourse is considered fornication if done knowingly
- If done in ignorance, it is a case of doubt that removes the punishment
- Child's lineage is established
- No dowry, no maintenance, no inheritance

## Comparison Table

| Ruling | Valid | Defective | Void |
|--------|-------|-----------|------|
| Conclusion | Concluded | Concluded with defect | Not concluded |
| Relations | Lawful | Unlawful | Unlawful |
| Dowry | Established | Equivalent dowry if consummated | Not established |
| Lineage | Established | Established if consummated | Established in case of doubt |
| Inheritance | Established | Not established | Not established |
| Annulment | Not required | Required | Separation required |

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf

### Umar ibn al-Khattab's Position on Shighar Marriage

It was reported that two men came to Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) having married each other's daughters in the shighar manner: one married his daughter to the other on condition that the other marry his daughter to him, with no dowry between them.

**Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said**: "This is the shighar that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ prohibited. Separate them!"

Then he said his famous statement: **"Had I known about this beforehand, I would have stoned them!"** - meaning he would have severely punished the perpetrator.

In another narration from Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with them): The Prophet ﷺ said: **"There is no shighar in Islam"** [Reported by Muslim]. The Rightly Guided Caliphs were keen to enforce this prohibition to protect women and preserve their right to the dowry.

### A Tahlil Story in the Time of Ibn Umar

A man came to Abdullah ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) and said: "A woman was divorced three times by her husband, so her brother married her to make her lawful for her first husband, without the first husband ordering him to do so. Does she become lawful for the first?"

**Ibn Umar said**: "No! Only a marriage of genuine desire. We used to consider this fornication during the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ" [Reported by al-Hakim who authenticated it].

**🌟 Lesson**: The Companions were keen to block the means of circumventing Allah's rulings, and that marriage must be a marriage of genuine desire, not a means of trickery.

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### Case One: Civil Marriage Without a Guardian

**Question**: A Muslim woman in France conducted her marriage at city hall (civilly) to a Muslim man, without an Islamic guardian and without Muslim witnesses, then they lived together for years and have children. What is the ruling on this marriage?

**Answer**: The civil contract alone is not sufficient in Islamic law. Marriage without a guardian is void or defective according to the majority of scholars. The couple must:
- Rectify the contract by performing it Islamically with the guardian and witnesses present
- The new contract validates the situation from that point forward
- The children's lineage is established to the father because intercourse due to doubt establishes lineage
- They must repent and seek forgiveness for what has passed

---

### Case Two: Hidden Temporary Marriage

**Question**: A young man studying abroad was offered by some friends a "temporary marriage" with a woman for the duration of his studies (3 years), then he would divorce her. Is this permissible?

**Answer**: This is mut'ah marriage which is forbidden by consensus of Ahl al-Sunnah, because time limitation voids the marriage. The Prophet ﷺ said: "Allah has forbidden temporary marriage on the day of Khaybar." It is also not permissible to circumvent this by having a pre-planned intention to divorce.

The lawful solution: Either marry a proper marriage with the intention of permanence, even if it ends in divorce later for unforeseen reasons, or be patient and abstain until stable marriage becomes possible.

### Case Three: Discovering the Wife is a Milk-Sister

**Question**: After 10 years of marriage and 3 children, the couple discovered that the husband's mother had breastfed the wife as a baby five complete feedings. What must they do?

**Answer**: If the prohibiting breastfeeding is established (5 feedings within the first two years):
- They must separate immediately because the marriage is void
- What has passed is forgiven because it was done in ignorance (doubt)
- The children's lineage is established to the father and the void marriage does not affect them
- The husband must provide maintenance during the waiting period and a separation gift

This confirms the importance of investigating before marriage regarding marriage impediments.

### Case Four: Marrying a Divorced Woman During Her Waiting Period

**Question**: A man proposed to a divorced woman and contracted marriage with her one month after her divorce, without knowing that the waiting period had not ended. What is the ruling?

**Answer**: Marriage during the waiting period is void by scholarly consensus, due to Allah's saying: "And do not resolve on the marriage contract until the decreed period reaches its end." They must:
- Separate immediately
- Wait for the waiting period from the first husband to end
- Begin a new waiting period from this consummation
- Then they may contract a new marriage after the waiting period ends
- Some scholars view her as permanently forbidden to him as punishment, but the preponderant view is permissibility if it was done in ignorance

---

### Case Five: Modern Tahlil Marriage

**Question**: A woman divorced three times agreed with a man to marry her and divorce her after consummation to make her lawful for her first husband, promising him money. Does she become lawful for the first?

**Answer**: This is tahlil marriage, cursed are its perpetrators. The Prophet ﷺ said: "Allah has cursed the one who makes lawful (muhallil) and the one for whom it is made lawful." It is void and she does not become lawful for the first because:
- The intention is not real marriage but making lawful
- The prior agreement invalidates it
- The money paid is forbidden bribery

She does not become lawful to the first husband except through a genuine marriage of desire with another man who intends to remain with her, then divorces her or dies.

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

**Question for Contemplation**: Many people take lightly "legal tricks" to get what they want, thinking that Islamic rulings are mere formalities.

🤔 **Reflect**: What is the difference between a forbidden "legal trick" and a permissible "legal concession"? Why did Allah curse the muhallil and the one for whom it is made lawful, while permitting marriage after the waiting period ends? Think about the objectives of Shariah in prohibiting these defective marriages.

- Defective marriage has a flaw in conditions and must be annulled
- Void marriage has a flaw in pillars and is not concluded at all
