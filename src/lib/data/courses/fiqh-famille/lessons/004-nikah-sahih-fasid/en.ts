## 📖 Introduction

### 📜 Scene: The Shocking Discovery

> **Years after their marriage...**
>
> A man discovered that his wife was breastfed by his mother when she was an infant.
>
> He came to the scholar in shock:
>
> *"I didn't know! We have children together!"*
>
> The scholar asked carefully, verified the facts, and said:
>
> **"If she was breastfed five times or more during the nursing period... she is your milk sister. This marriage should never have occurred."**
>
> The man wept: *"What about our children?"*
>
> The scholar said:
>
> **"The children are legitimate because you didn't know. But you must separate."**

> ⚠️ **Ignorance of marriage impediments can lead to tragedy!**

---

### 📜 Scene: The Marriage That Was Fixed

> **In the imam's office...**
>
> A young couple came saying:
>
> *"We married abroad. The imam there just had us sign papers. There was no wali, and we're not sure about witnesses..."*
>
> The imam asked questions, then said:
>
> **"Let's redo the contract properly right now. Your wali is needed, witnesses must be present, and clear offer and acceptance must occur."**
>
> They did so, and left with peace of mind.

> 🎯 **A doubtful marriage can often be corrected — better to fix it!**
