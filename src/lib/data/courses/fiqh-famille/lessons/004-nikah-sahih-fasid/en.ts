# Valid and Invalid Marriage

## Categories of Marriage According to Validity

Marriage is divided into three categories based on validity:

1. **Valid Marriage (Sahih)**: One that fulfills all its pillars and conditions
2. **Defective Marriage (Fasid)**: One where a condition is missing
3. **Void Marriage (Batil)**: One where a pillar is missing

## Valid Marriage

### Definition

A marriage that fulfills all its legal pillars and conditions, and is not accompanied by any impediment to its validity.

### Conditions for Marriage Validity

| Condition | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Identification of spouses | By name, description, or indication |
| Consent of both spouses | Virgin's silence is consent, non-virgin must express |
| The guardian | No marriage without guardian |
| Witnessing | Two upright witnesses |
| Absence of impediments | Kinship, breastfeeding, affinity |
| The dowry | Even if not mentioned in the contract |

### Effects of Valid Marriage

1. Permissibility of intimacy between spouses
2. Obligation of dowry for the wife
3. Obligation of maintenance and housing
4. Establishment of children's lineage
5. Establishment of inheritance between spouses
6. Prohibition through affinity

## Defective Marriage

### Definition

A marriage where a condition of validity is missing, while its pillars remain intact.

### Examples of Defective Marriage

#### 1. Shighar Marriage

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"There is no shighar in Islam"** [Reported by Muslim]

**Definition**: A man marries his daughter or sister to another on condition that the other marries his daughter or sister to him, each woman serving as the dowry for the other.

**Reason for prohibition**: Harm to the woman and deprivation of her dowry.

#### 2. Tahlil Marriage (Marriage of Legalization)

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Allah has cursed the one who makes lawful (remarriage) and the one for whom it is made lawful"** [Reported by Ahmad and Tirmidhi]

**Definition**: A man marries a woman divorced three times with the intention of making her lawful for her first husband.

**Reason for prohibition**: Circumventing divine law and using the woman as a means.

#### 3. Temporary Marriage (Mut'a)

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Allah has forbidden temporary marriage on the day of Khaybar"** [Bukhari and Muslim]

**Definition**: Marriage limited to a specific duration.

**Reason for prohibition**: Contradicts the objectives of marriage of stability and tranquility.

### Ruling on Defective Marriage

- Must be annulled immediately
- If consummation occurred:
  - Child's lineage is established
  - Equivalent dowry is due
  - Waiting period is obligatory for the woman
- Inheritance between spouses is not established

## Void Marriage

### Definition

A marriage where a pillar is missing, so it is not concluded at all.

### Examples of Void Marriage

#### 1. Marriage with Prohibited Women

Allah says: **"Prohibited to you are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters..."** [An-Nisa: 23]

#### 2. Marrying a Fifth Wife When Already Having Four

Allah says: **"Marry those that please you of women, two, three, or four"** [An-Nisa: 3]

#### 3. Marrying a Woman in Another's Waiting Period

Allah says: **"And do not resolve on the marriage contract until the decreed period reaches its end"** [Al-Baqarah: 235]

#### 4. Marriage of a Muslim Woman to a Non-Muslim

Allah says: **"And do not marry polytheistic men until they believe"** [Al-Baqarah: 221]

### Ruling on Void Marriage

- Not concluded at all
- Separation is immediately obligatory
- Intercourse is considered fornication if done knowingly
- If done in ignorance, it is a case of doubt that removes the punishment
- Child's lineage is established
- No dowry, no maintenance, no inheritance

## Comparison Table

| Ruling | Valid | Defective | Void |
|--------|-------|-----------|------|
| Conclusion | Concluded | Concluded with defect | Not concluded |
| Relations | Lawful | Unlawful | Unlawful |
| Dowry | Established | Equivalent dowry if consummated | Not established |
| Lineage | Established | Established if consummated | Established in case of doubt |
| Inheritance | Established | Not established | Not established |
| Annulment | Not required | Required | Separation required |

## Lesson Summary

- Valid marriage is one that fulfills all its pillars and conditions
- Defective marriage has a flaw in conditions and must be annulled
- Void marriage has a flaw in pillars and is not concluded at all
- Among prohibited marriages: shighar, tahlil, and mut'a
