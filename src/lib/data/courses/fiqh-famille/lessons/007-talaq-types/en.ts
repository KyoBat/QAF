## Types of Divorce According to Revocability

### First: Revocable Divorce

#### Definition
The divorce in which the husband has the right to take back his wife during the waiting period without a new contract.

#### Its Conditions
1. That it be after consummation
2. That it be before the third divorce
3. That it not be for compensation (khul')
4. That the woman be in the waiting period

#### Rulings of Revocable Divorce

| Ruling | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Taking back | The husband's right during the waiting period without her permission |
| Continuity of marriage | She remains legally a wife during the waiting period |
| Maintenance and housing | She is entitled to them during the waiting period |
| Inheritance | Each inherits from the other during the waiting period |
| Privacy | He may be alone with her |

#### How to Effect the Taking Back

**By speech:**
- "I have taken you back" or "I have returned you"
- "I have kept you" or "I have brought you back"

**By action:**
- Intercourse with the intention of taking back
- Kissing or touching with desire with the intention of taking back

**Witnessing:**
- Recommended according to the majority
- Allah says: **"And take two just witnesses from among you"** [At-Talaq: 2]

### Second: Irrevocable Divorce

#### Definition
The divorce in which the husband cannot take back his wife except with a new contract, or cannot at all.

#### Types of Irrevocable Divorce

**1. Minor Irrevocability:**

| Situation | Ruling |
|-----------|--------|
| Divorce before consummation | Minor irrevocable |
| End of waiting period | She becomes minor irrevocable |
| Khul' | Minor irrevocable |

**Its ruling:**
- Requires a new contract and a new dowry
- With her consent and her guardian's consent
- Does not require a muhallil

**2. Major Irrevocability:**

This is the third divorce.

Allah says: **"Divorce is twice. Then either keep her in an acceptable manner or release her with good treatment"** [Al-Baqarah: 229]

And Allah says: **"If he divorces her, she is not lawful to him until she marries another husband"** [Al-Baqarah: 230]

**Its ruling:**
- She is not lawful to him until she marries another husband in a valid marriage
- The marriage must be a marriage of desire, not a marriage of tahlil
- The second husband must actually consummate the marriage
- The second husband divorces her or dies
- Her waiting period from the second ends
- Then she becomes lawful to the first with a new contract

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf: The Wisdom of Umar ibn al-Khattab

A man came to Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) complaining about his wife. When he stood at his door, he heard Umar's wife raising her voice at him. The man turned to leave.

Umar came out and saw him leaving, and said: **"What is your need?"**

He said: I came to complain about my wife, and I heard your wife!

Umar said: **"My brother, she cooks for me, bakes for me, washes my clothes, and nurses my children—and none of that is obligatory upon her—and my heart finds contentment with her away from the forbidden. Should I not bear with her?!"**

**Lesson**: Patience and overlooking are the foundation of marriage continuity.

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

**Question for Thought**: 

Divorce is the husband's legal right, but:
- Should we do everything that is permissible?
- What are the psychological effects on the children?
- Have you exhausted all means of reconciliation?

Remember the verse: ﴿If you fear a breach between the two, send an arbitrator from his family and an arbitrator from her family﴾

**Before you utter divorce, ask yourself:**
1. Have you prayed istikhara?
2. Have you consulted people of knowledge?
3. Have you tried an arbitrator from your family and an arbitrator from her family?
4. What will happen to the children?

## Conclusion

Divorce has multiple types, and each type has its own rulings. The Muslim must learn these rulings before proceeding with divorce, take his time and seek Allah's guidance, for divorce is the last solution, not the first.
