# Types of Divorce

## Introduction

Divorce is the dissolution of the marriage contract through a specific wording. It is legal but is the most hated lawful thing to Allah. Divorce has multiple types in terms of explicit and implicit, revocable and irrevocable.

| Privacy | He may be alone with her |

#### How to Effect the Taking Back

**By speech:**
- "I have taken you back" or "I have returned you"
- "I have kept you" or "I have brought you back"

**By action:**
- Intercourse with the intention of taking back
- Kissing or touching with desire with the intention of taking back

**Witnessing:**
- Recommended according to the majority
- Allah says: **"And take two just witnesses from among you"** [At-Talaq: 2]

### Second: Irrevocable Divorce

#### Definition
The divorce in which the husband cannot take back his wife except with a new contract, or cannot at all.

#### Types of Irrevocable Divorce

**2. Major Irrevocability:**

This is the third divorce.

Allah says: **"Divorce is twice. Then either keep her in an acceptable manner or release her with good treatment"** [Al-Baqarah: 229]

And Allah says: **"If he divorces her, she is not lawful to him until she marries another husband"** [Al-Baqarah: 230]

**Its ruling:**
- She is not lawful to him until she marries another husband in a valid marriage
- The marriage must be a marriage of desire, not a marriage of tahlil
- The second husband must actually consummate the marriage
- The second husband divorces her or dies
- Her waiting period from the second ends
- Then she becomes lawful to the first with a new contract
