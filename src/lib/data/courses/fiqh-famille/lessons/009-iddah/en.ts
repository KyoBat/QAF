# The Waiting Period (Al-'Iddah)

## Definition of 'Iddah

**Linguistic meaning**: The term 'iddah comes from the Arabic word meaning "to count" or "enumerate," as it typically involves counting menstrual periods or months.

**Legal definition**: A period during which a woman must wait after the dissolution of her marriage to determine the state of her womb, for worship, or to mourn her husband.

## Legal Basis

### From the Quran

Allah says: **﴾Divorced women shall wait concerning themselves for three monthly periods﴿** [Al-Baqarah: 228]

And He says: **﴾Those of you who die and leave wives behind, they shall wait concerning themselves for four months and ten days﴿** [Al-Baqarah: 234]

### From the Sunnah

Fatima bint Qays reported that the Prophet ﷺ told her: **"Observe your waiting period in the house of Ibn Umm Maktum"** [Reported by Muslim]

## Wisdom Behind 'Iddah

1. **Establishing uterine vacancy**: To preserve lineage
2. **Allowing reconciliation**: In revocable divorce
3. **Honoring marriage**: Showing its significance
4. **Respecting the husband**: In the mourning period
5. **Protecting the fetus**: If pregnant

## Types of 'Iddah

### I. 'Iddah of Divorced Women

#### 1. Pregnant woman
Her waiting period: **until delivery**, whether soon or late.

Allah says: **﴾And for those who are pregnant, their term is until they deliver their burden﴿** [At-Talaq: 4]

#### 2. Menstruating woman
Her waiting period: **three quru'** (three menstrual cycles according to Hanbalis and Hanafis, or three periods of purity according to Malikis and Shafi'is).

Allah says: **﴾Divorced women shall wait concerning themselves for three monthly periods﴿** [Al-Baqarah: 228]

#### 3. Post-menopausal or pre-pubescent woman
Her waiting period: **three months**.

Allah says: **﴾For those of your women who have despaired of menstruation, if you have doubt, their waiting period is three months, and also for those who have not menstruated﴿** [At-Talaq: 4]

### II. 'Iddah of a Widow

#### 1. Non-pregnant
Her waiting period: **four months and ten days**.

Allah says: **﴾Those of you who die and leave wives behind, they shall wait concerning themselves for four months and ten days﴿** [Al-Baqarah: 234]

#### 2. Pregnant
Her waiting period: **until delivery**, even if it occurs moments after the death.

Subay'a Al-Aslamiyya reported that she delivered a few nights after her husband's death, and the Prophet ﷺ permitted her to remarry. [Bukhari and Muslim]

### III. 'Iddah of Khul'

**Three menstrual cycles** according to the majority, or **one menstrual cycle** according to some scholars, based on the hadith of Ibn Abbas.

### IV. 'Iddah of Marriage Annulment

Such as annulment due to defect, breastfeeding, etc.: **three quru'** like divorce.

## Rules of 'Iddah

### 1. Housing

A woman observing 'iddah from revocable or irrevocable divorce has the right to remain in the marital home.

Allah says: **﴾Do not expel them from their houses, nor should they leave﴿** [At-Talaq: 1]

### 2. Financial Maintenance

| Type of 'Iddah | Right to Maintenance |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Revocable divorce | Full maintenance |
| Irrevocable divorce (pregnant) | Maintenance until delivery |
| Irrevocable divorce (not pregnant) | No maintenance according to majority |
| Widowhood | No maintenance from inheritance |

### 3. Mourning (Al-Ihdad)

**Definition**: Abstaining from adornment and perfume during the waiting period.

**Ruling**: Obligatory for widows, recommended for women divorced irrevocably.

**Duration**: Four months and ten days for widows.

### What the Mourning Woman Must Avoid

- Perfume
- Jewelry
- Decorative kohl (eyeliner)
- Decorative henna
- Dyed garments for beautification
- Sleeping outside her home

Umm 'Atiyya reported that the Prophet ﷺ said: **"A woman should not mourn for more than three days except for her husband: four months and ten days. She should not wear dyed garments except 'asb cloth, nor apply kohl, nor touch perfume"** [Bukhari and Muslim]

## End of 'Iddah

### 1. By menstruation
The 'iddah ends with the completion of the third menstrual cycle according to Hanbalis.

### 2. By months
It ends upon completion of the prescribed months.

### 3. By delivery
It ends with complete delivery, even of a miscarried fetus showing human features.

## Important Issues

### 1. Change of 'Iddah
If a man divorces his wife then dies during her waiting period:
- **Revocable divorce**: She switches to the widow's 'iddah
- **Irrevocable divorce**: She continues the divorce 'iddah

### 2. Overlapping 'Iddah
If a woman in 'iddah marries another man:
- The marriage is void
- She completes the first 'iddah then observes one from the second

### 3. Doubt about 'Iddah completion
One bases judgment on certainty: the 'iddah continues until its completion is confirmed.

## Conclusion

The 'iddah is a right of Allah and a right of the spouses. It was prescribed for great wisdoms, primarily preserving lineage and allowing opportunity for reconciliation. Its duration varies according to the woman's situation, and she must observe its rules regarding housing and mourning when obligatory.
