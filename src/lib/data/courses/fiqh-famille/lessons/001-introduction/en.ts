## 🌟 Why is This Science So Important?

### 1. The Family is the Foundation of Society

> **﴿ O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men and women ﴾**
>
> — **[An-Nisa: 1]**

| Reality | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| 🏠 Strong family | Produces strong individuals |
| 💔 Broken family | Produces lost generations |

### 2. The Five Objectives of Sharia Pass Through the Family

| Objective (Maqsid) | How the Family Realizes It |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| 🕌 **Preservation of Religion** | Islamic upbringing of children |
| 💓 **Preservation of Life** | Mutual protection and care |
| 🧠 **Preservation of Intellect** | Transmission of knowledge |
| 👪 **Preservation of Lineage** | Lawful marriage, clear lineage |
| 💎 **Preservation of Wealth** | Organized inheritance, defined nafaqa |

### 3. Without This Science, Chaos Ensues

> ⚠️ **Alarming Statistics**: In many Muslim countries, divorce rates exceed 30%. Most conflicts arise from **ignorance of the rules** rather than bad intentions.

>
> — **[An-Nur: 32]**
