## 📖 The Two Categories

### Definition

## ☀️ Sunni (Sunnah) Divorce

### Conditions

| Condition | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1️⃣ During purity (tuhr) | Not during menstruation |
| 2️⃣ Without intercourse in that cycle | Hasn't had relations since she became pure |
| 3️⃣ One divorce only | Not multiple at once |

### Why These Conditions?

| Condition | Wisdom |
|-----------|--------|
| 🩸 Not during menses | So 'iddah can be properly calculated |
| 🚫 No recent intimacy | She might be pregnant (changes 'iddah) |
| 1️⃣ Only one | Preserves chance of reconciliation |

### The Evidence

> When **Ibn Umar** divorced during menstruation, the Prophet ﷺ ordered him to take her back and wait:
>
> **"...until she becomes pure, then menstruates again, then becomes pure again. Then if he wishes, he may keep her, or divorce her before having relations."**
>
> — **[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]**

## 🌙 Bid'i (Innovated) Divorce

### What Makes It Bid'i

| Violation | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| 🩸 During menstruation | She is on her period |
| 🤰 During nifas | Post-childbirth bleeding |
| 💑 After intercourse | In purity cycle after intimacy |
| 3️⃣ Multiple at once | "I divorce you three times!" |

### Ruling on Bid'i Divorce

| Aspect | Ruling |
|--------|--------|
| 🔴 Sinful | He is sinning |
| ⚖️ Does it count? | Majority: Yes, it counts |
| 🔄 What should he do? | Take her back, wait for proper time |

### The Disagreement

| View | Position |
|------|----------|
| 🔵 Majority | Bid'i divorce counts (but is sinful) |
| 🟢 Some scholars | It doesn't count (Ibn Hazm's view) |
| ⚖️ Strongest | It counts but he must repent |

## 📊 Comparison Table

## 📜 Special Cases

### Divorced Before Consummation

| Situation | Ruling |

### Pregnant Woman

| Situation | Ruling |
|-----------|--------|
| 🤰 Confirmed pregnancy | Can divorce anytime |
| 📊 Reason | 'Iddah is until birth, not by menstrual cycles |

### Post-Menopausal Woman
