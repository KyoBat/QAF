# Sunnah vs Bid'ah Divorce

## Introduction

Although divorce is permissible, the Wise Legislator has established rules and etiquettes for it. Some divorces conform to the Sunnah (Sunnah divorce), and others contradict it (Bid'ah divorce). This classification is among the most important matters a Muslim must know before proceeding with divorce.

## Sunnah Divorce

### Definition

It is the divorce that conforms to the Sunnah, which Allah commanded in His Book and His Messenger ﷺ in his Sunnah.

Allah says: **"O Prophet, when you divorce women, divorce them for their waiting period and count the period"** [At-Talaq: 1]

### Conditions of Sunnah Divorce

| Condition | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Divorce during purity | Without having had intercourse with her |
| One divorce | Not two or three together |
| No succession | Not following with another divorce in the same purity |

### Detail of Sunnah Divorce Conditions

#### First Condition: Divorcing During Purity Without Intercourse

**Wisdom:**
- So she begins her waiting period with a complete purity
- So as not to prolong the waiting period for her
- To ensure there is no pregnancy

**Evidence:**
Ibn Umar divorced his wife while she was menstruating. Umar asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said: **"Command him to take her back, then keep her until she is pure, then menstruates, then is pure, then if he wishes he keeps her, and if he wishes he divorces her before touching her. That is the waiting period that Allah commanded for divorcing women"** [Bukhari and Muslim]

#### Second Condition: Divorcing with One Divorce

**Wisdom:**
- Keeping the door of taking back open
- Not harming the woman
- Taking time to think

**Evidence:**
The Prophet ﷺ said to one who divorced three times: **"Are you playing with the Book of Allah while I am among you?"** [Reported by An-Nasai]

#### Third Condition: Not Following with Another Divorce During the Waiting Period

**Wisdom:**
- Giving a chance for reconciliation
- Thinking about consequences
- Not rushing to end the marriage

---

## Bid'ah Divorce

### Definition

It is the divorce that contradicts the Sunnah, prohibited by Islamic law.

### Types of Bid'ah Divorce

#### First Type: Divorce During Menstruation

**Its ruling:** Prohibited by consensus

**Evidence:** The hadith of Ibn Umar mentioned above, where the Prophet ﷺ commanded taking her back.

**Wisdom of prohibition:**
- Prolonging the waiting period for the woman
- Causing harm to her
- Uncertainty about pregnancy

#### Second Type: Divorce During Purity with Intercourse

**Its ruling:** Prohibited according to the majority

**Evidence:** His saying ﷺ: **"Then if he wishes, he divorces her before touching her"**

**Wisdom:**
- Possibility of pregnancy, so she doesn't know how to count her waiting period
- Ensuring there is no regret after intercourse

#### Third Type: Triple Divorce at Once

**Forms:**
1. Saying: "You are divorced three times"
2. Saying: "You are divorced, you are divorced, you are divorced" in one session
3. Divorcing in each purity before taking back

**Its ruling:** Prohibited and contrary to the Sunnah

**Evidence:**
The Prophet ﷺ said to one who divorced three times: **"Are you playing with the Book of Allah?"**

## Does Bid'ah Divorce Take Effect?

### Scholarly Difference

| Opinion | Proponents | Evidence |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Takes effect with sin | The majority | Its occurrence in the Prophet's ﷺ time and his command to take back |
| Does not take effect | Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn al-Qayyim | Prohibition implies invalidity |

### Divorce During Menstruation

**Majority opinion (takes effect):**
- The Prophet ﷺ commanded Ibn Umar to take her back, and taking back comes after divorce
- Consensus of the Companions on its validity

**Ibn Taymiyyah's opinion (does not take effect):**
- Taking back is not evidence of validity
- Prohibition indicates invalidity

**The preponderant view:** Takes effect with sin, due to the strength of the majority's evidence.

### Triple Divorce at Once

**Majority opinion:** Counts as three

**Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn al-Qayyim's opinion:** Counts as one

| Argument | Details |
|----------|---------|
| The majority | The practice of Umar and the Companions counting it as three |
| Ibn Taymiyyah | In the Prophet's ﷺ and Abu Bakr's time, it counted as one |

## Exceptions to Bid'ah Divorce

### Those for Whom Bid'ah Divorce is Not Conceivable

| Woman | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| One with whom marriage was not consummated | No waiting period for her |
| The pregnant woman | Her waiting period ends at delivery |
| The menopausal woman | She does not menstruate |
| The young girl | She has not yet menstruated |

**Evidence:**
Allah says: **"And those of your women who have despaired of menstruation, if you are in doubt, their waiting period is three months, and also for those who have not yet menstruated"** [At-Talaq: 4]

And Allah says: **"And those who are pregnant, their term is until they deliver"** [At-Talaq: 4]

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf

### Ibn Umar and the Bid'ah Divorce

Abdullah ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) reported that he divorced his wife while she was menstruating. His father Umar went to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and informed him of this.

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ became upset, then said: **"Command him to take her back, then keep her until she is pure, then menstruates, then is pure, then if he wishes he keeps her, and if he wishes he divorces her before touching her. That is the waiting period that Allah commanded for divorcing women."**

Ibn Umar said: So I took her back, and that divorce was counted against me.

**The lesson:** The Prophet ﷺ did not merely explain the error, but commanded immediate correction, and taught the Ummah that divorce has its proper time in the Sharia. Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) continued narrating this hadith and warning against divorce during menstruation throughout his life.

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### Case One: Divorce During Extreme Anger

**Question:** I divorced my wife three times in a moment of extreme anger after a fight, and I wasn't aware of what I was saying. What is the ruling?

**Answer:** If the anger completely took away your consciousness (closure), then the divorce does not take effect. However, if you were aware of what you said despite the anger, the preponderant view is that it takes effect. Therefore, it is always advised to leave the place when angry and seek refuge from Satan.

---

### Case Two: Divorce via Text Message

**Question:** I sent my wife a WhatsApp message saying "You are divorced," then I regretted it. Does it take effect?

**Answer:** Divorce by writing takes effect according to the majority of scholars if it was with the intention of divorce. Writing is like speaking in effecting divorce. If it was the first or second divorce, take her back before the 'iddah ends.

---

### Case Three: Combining Three Divorces

**Question:** I said to my wife in one sitting: "You are divorced, divorced, divorced." Does it count as three or one?

**Answer:** This is a disputed matter:
- **The majority of scholars:** It counts as three, and this is the position of the four schools
- **Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn al-Qayyim:** It counts as one

The safer approach is to follow the majority view, and consult a trusted mufti in your case.

---

### Case Four: Divorce During Purity with Intercourse

**Question:** I divorced my wife during purity, but I had intercourse with her at the beginning of this purity. Is my divorce Sunnah?

**Answer:** No, this is a Bid'ah divorce because it occurred during a purity in which you had touched her. Sunnah divorce is in a purity where you did not touch her. The divorce takes effect with sin according to the majority.

---

### Case Five: Threatening with Divorce

**Question:** I always threaten my wife with divorce during any disagreement without actually intending divorce. Does it take effect?

**Answer:** If the wording is explicit ("You are divorced"), it takes effect according to the majority even without intending it. So beware of uttering divorce in jest or as a threat. The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Three things, their seriousness is serious and their jest is serious: marriage, divorce, and resumption."**

---

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

**Question for reflection:**

Why do you think the Sharia specified a particular time for divorce (during purity without intercourse) and did not leave it to any time the husband wishes?

Reflect on:
- The psychological wisdom for both spouses
- The wisdom related to the waiting period
- The wisdom in preventing haste and regret

These legal restrictions are a mercy, not a burden, for they protect the family from hasty decisions that lead to regret.

---

## Conclusion

Sunnah divorce is that which conforms to the Sharia: the man divorces his wife with one divorce during a purity without intercourse. Bid'ah divorce is prohibited and its doer sins, and it takes effect according to the majority of scholars with sin. The Muslim is commanded to follow the Sunnah in all his affairs, including divorce if he is compelled to it.

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Allah hates every man and woman who frequently taste marriage"** [Reported by At-Tabarani — graded weak by some muhaddithin, but its meaning is sound]
