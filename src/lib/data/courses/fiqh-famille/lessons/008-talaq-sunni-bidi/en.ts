# Sunnah vs Bid'ah Divorce

## Introduction

Although divorce is permissible, the Wise Legislator has established rules and etiquettes for it. Some divorces conform to the Sunnah (Sunnah divorce), and others contradict it (Bid'ah divorce). This classification is among the most important matters a Muslim must know before proceeding with divorce.

## Sunnah Divorce

### Definition

It is the divorce that conforms to the Sunnah, which Allah commanded in His Book and His Messenger ﷺ in his Sunnah.

Allah says: **"O Prophet, when you divorce women, divorce them for their waiting period and count the period"** [At-Talaq: 1]

### Conditions of Sunnah Divorce

| Condition | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Divorce during purity | Without having had intercourse with her |
| One divorce | Not two or three together |
| No succession | Not following with another divorce in the same purity |

### Detail of Sunnah Divorce Conditions

#### First Condition: Divorcing During Purity Without Intercourse

**Wisdom:**
- So she begins her waiting period with a complete purity
- So as not to prolong the waiting period for her
- To ensure there is no pregnancy

**Evidence:**
Ibn Umar divorced his wife while she was menstruating. Umar asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said: **"Command him to take her back, then keep her until she is pure, then menstruates, then is pure, then if he wishes he keeps her, and if he wishes he divorces her before touching her. That is the waiting period that Allah commanded for divorcing women"** [Bukhari and Muslim]

#### Second Condition: Divorcing with One Divorce

**Wisdom:**
- Keeping the door of taking back open
- Not harming the woman
- Taking time to think

**Evidence:**
The Prophet ﷺ said to one who divorced three times: **"Are you playing with the Book of Allah while I am among you?"** [Reported by An-Nasai]

#### Third Condition: Not Following with Another Divorce During the Waiting Period

**Wisdom:**
- Giving a chance for reconciliation
- Thinking about consequences
- Not rushing to end the marriage

## Bid'ah Divorce

### Definition

It is the divorce that contradicts the Sunnah, prohibited by Islamic law.

### Types of Bid'ah Divorce

#### First Type: Divorce During Menstruation

**Its ruling:** Prohibited by consensus

**Evidence:** The hadith of Ibn Umar mentioned above, where the Prophet ﷺ commanded taking her back.

**Wisdom of prohibition:**
- Prolonging the waiting period for the woman
- Causing harm to her
- Uncertainty about pregnancy

#### Second Type: Divorce During Purity with Intercourse

**Its ruling:** Prohibited according to the majority

**Evidence:** His saying ﷺ: **"Then if he wishes, he divorces her before touching her"**

**Wisdom:**
- Possibility of pregnancy, so she doesn't know how to count her waiting period
- Ensuring there is no regret after intercourse

#### Third Type: Triple Divorce at Once

**Forms:**
1. Saying: "You are divorced three times"
2. Saying: "You are divorced, you are divorced, you are divorced" in one session
3. Divorcing in each purity before taking back

**Its ruling:** Prohibited and contrary to the Sunnah

**Evidence:**
The Prophet ﷺ said to one who divorced three times: **"Are you playing with the Book of Allah?"**

## Does Bid'ah Divorce Take Effect?

### Scholarly Difference

| Opinion | Proponents | Evidence |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Takes effect with sin | The majority | Its occurrence in the Prophet's ﷺ time and his command to take back |
| Does not take effect | Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn al-Qayyim | Prohibition implies invalidity |

### Divorce During Menstruation

**Majority opinion (takes effect):**
- The Prophet ﷺ commanded Ibn Umar to take her back, and taking back comes after divorce
- Consensus of the Companions on its validity

**Ibn Taymiyyah's opinion (does not take effect):**
- Taking back is not evidence of validity
- Prohibition indicates invalidity

**The preponderant view:** Takes effect with sin, due to the strength of the majority's evidence.

### Triple Divorce at Once

**Majority opinion:** Counts as three

**Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn al-Qayyim's opinion:** Counts as one

| Argument | Details |
|----------|---------|
| The majority | The practice of Umar and the Companions counting it as three |
| Ibn Taymiyyah | In the Prophet's ﷺ and Abu Bakr's time, it counted as one |

## Exceptions to Bid'ah Divorce

### Those for Whom Bid'ah Divorce is Not Conceivable

| Woman | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| One with whom marriage was not consummated | No waiting period for her |
| The pregnant woman | Her waiting period ends at delivery |
| The menopausal woman | She does not menstruate |
| The young girl | She has not yet menstruated |

**Evidence:**
Allah says: **"And those of your women who have despaired of menstruation, if you are in doubt, their waiting period is three months, and also for those who have not yet menstruated"** [At-Talaq: 4]

And Allah says: **"And those who are pregnant, their term is until they deliver"** [At-Talaq: 4]

## Difference Between Sunnah and Bid'ah Divorce

| Description | Sunnah Divorce | Bid'ah Divorce |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| Ruling | Permissible or recommended for need | Prohibited |
| Time | During purity without intercourse | During menstruation or purity with intercourse |
| Number | One divorce | Two or three together |
| Effect | Takes effect certainly | Takes effect with sin (majority) |
| Consequence | No sin on its doer | Its doer sins |

## Important Rulings

### Divorce of the Pregnant Woman

- Her divorce is Sunnah according to the majority
- Because her waiting period ends at delivery, not by menstruation
- She may be divorced at any time

**Evidence:**
The Prophet ﷺ said to Ibn Umar: **"Command him to take her back..."** then he mentioned purity, and did not mention pregnancy.

### Divorce of the Woman with Irregular Bleeding

- She may be divorced at any time
- Because her blood is blood of illness, not menstruation

### Divorce of One Who Does Not Menstruate

- The menopausal woman and young girl may be divorced at any time
- Due to the absence of menstruation for them

## Conclusion

Sunnah divorce is that which conforms to the Sharia: the man divorces his wife with one divorce during a purity without intercourse. Bid'ah divorce is prohibited and its doer sins, and it takes effect according to the majority of scholars with sin. The Muslim is commanded to follow the Sunnah in all his affairs, including divorce if he is compelled to it.

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Allah hates every man and woman who frequently taste marriage"** [Reported by At-Tabarani]
