# Pillars of Marriage

## Definition of a Pillar (Rukn)

A pillar is that without which something cannot be complete and is part of its essence. The pillars of marriage are the fundamental elements without which the contract is not valid.

## First Pillar: The Two Spouses

### Conditions for the Husband

1. **Masculinity**: Being a man
2. **Identification**: Being specifically identified
3. **Absence of impediments**: Not being a mahram to the woman
4. **Islam**: If the wife is Muslim

### Conditions for the Wife

1. **Femininity**: Being a woman
2. **Identification**: Being specifically identified
3. **Absence of impediments**: Such as waiting period or state of ihram
4. **Non-prohibition**: Not being among prohibited women

## Second Pillar: Offer and Acceptance

### Definition of Offer and Acceptance

- **Offer (Ijab)**: The statement issued by the guardian or his representative
- **Acceptance (Qabul)**: The statement issued by the groom or his agent

### Formula of the Contract

Allah says: **"Marry them with the permission of their families"** [An-Nisa: 25]

**Explicit formulas:**
- "I give you my daughter in marriage" - "I accept"
- "I marry my daughter to you" - "I accept this marriage"

### Conditions of the Formula

| Condition | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Agreement between offer and acceptance | Acceptance must correspond to the offer |
| Continuity | Acceptance must follow offer in the same session |
| No suspension | Not suspended on a future condition |
| No time limitation | Not limited to a specific time (temporary marriage is forbidden) |

## Third Pillar: The Guardian (Wali)

### Evidence for Requiring a Guardian

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"There is no marriage without a guardian"** [Reported by Abu Dawud and Tirmidhi]

And he ﷺ said: **"Any woman who marries without the permission of her guardian, her marriage is void, her marriage is void, her marriage is void"** [Reported by Tirmidhi]

### Order of Guardians

1. **The father**: The most entitled guardian
2. **Paternal grandfather**: In the absence of the father
3. **Son then his son**: If she was previously married
4. **Full brother then paternal half-brother**
5. **Son of full brother then paternal half-brother**
6. **Full paternal uncle then paternal half-uncle**
7. **Son of full paternal uncle then paternal half-uncle**
8. **The sultan or judge**: In the absence of guardians

### Conditions of the Guardian

- Islam (if the woman is Muslim)
- Puberty
- Sanity
- Masculinity
- Freedom
- Uprightness (according to some scholars)

## Fourth Pillar: Witnessing

### Evidence for Requiring Witnesses

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"There is no marriage without a guardian and two upright witnesses"** [Reported by Ibn Hibban]

### Conditions for Witnesses

1. Number: At least two
2. Masculinity
3. Uprightness
4. Puberty and sanity
5. Hearing and sight
6. Islam (if both spouses are Muslim)

### Wisdom Behind Requiring Witnesses

- Announcing and publicizing the marriage
- Preserving the rights of the spouses
- Distinguishing marriage from fornication
- Establishing lineage

## Summary Table of Pillars

| Pillar | Main Condition | Evidence |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| The two spouses | Absence of impediments | Verses of prohibition |
| Offer and acceptance | Explicit formula | "Marry them with permission of their families" |
| The guardian | Presence of valid guardian | "No marriage without guardian" |
| Witnessing | Two upright witnesses | "And two upright witnesses" |

## Lesson Summary

- The pillars of marriage are four: the spouses, the formula, the guardian, and witnessing
- Marriage is not valid if any of its pillars is missing
- Requiring a guardian and witnesses protects the rights of the woman and family
- The formula must be explicit, unconditional, and not time-limited
