# Child Custody (Al-Hadanah)

## Definition of Hadanah

**Linguistic meaning**: The Arabic term "hadanah" comes from "hidn" (the side/flank), as the mother holds the child close to her side.

**Legal definition**: It is the **care and upbringing of one who cannot take care of themselves**, ensuring their physical, psychological, and intellectual development.

Allah says: {Mothers shall breastfeed their children for two complete years} [Al-Baqarah: 233]

## Legal Ruling on Custody

Custody is **obligatory** (wajib) because abandoning the child would lead to their destruction.

Custody is primarily the **right of the child**, then the right of the custodian.

The Prophet ﷺ said: «**Each of you is a shepherd and each is responsible for his flock**» [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]

## Priority Order of Custodians

### First: The Mother

The mother has **absolute priority** for custody of her young child, by scholarly consensus.

**Evidence:**
- Hadith of Abdullah ibn Amr: A woman said: "O Messenger of Allah, my womb was a vessel for this child, my breast was his drink, and my lap was his shelter. His father has divorced me and wants to take him from me." The Prophet ﷺ said: «**You have more right to him as long as you do not remarry**»

### Second: Order of female custodians after the mother

1. **Maternal grandmother** and her ascendants
2. **Paternal grandmother** and her ascendants
3. **Full sister**
4. **Uterine sister** (same mother)
5. **Consanguine sister** (same father)
6. **Maternal aunt**
7. **Paternal aunt**
8. **Brother's daughter**
9. **Sister's daughter**

### Third: Transfer to Male Relatives

If no female custodian is available, custody passes to men:

1. **The father**
2. **Paternal grandfather** and his ascendants
3. **Full brother**
4. **Consanguine brother**
5. **Nephew** (brother's son)
6. **Paternal uncle**
7. **Paternal cousin**

## Duration of Custody

### Hanbali Opinion:
- **Boy**: until 7 years old
- **Girl**: until 7 years old, then stays with the father

### Maliki Opinion:
- **Boy**: until puberty
- **Girl**: until marriage and consummation

### Shafi'i Opinion:
- **Child's choice** at the age of discernment (7 years)

**Evidence for choice:**
> Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet ﷺ let a boy choose between his father and mother [Ahmad and Tirmidhi]

## Causes of Loss of Custody

Custody is lost for several reasons:

### 1. The custodian's remarriage to a stranger
The Prophet ﷺ said: «**You have more right to him as long as you do not remarry**»

### 2. Immorality (fisq) of the custodian
The immoral person cannot be trusted with the child's upbringing.

### 3. Traveling for permanent relocation
If the custodian wants to move to a distant country preventing the other parent from seeing the child.

### 4. Abandonment of the claim
If the custodian does not claim custody for a long period.

### 5. Harm to the child
Such as neglect or mistreatment of the child.

## Visitation Rights

### Father's right:
If the child is with the mother, the father has the right to see and check on the child.

### Mother's right:
If the child is with the father, the mother has the right to visit.

**Principle**: The child's best interest takes priority while respecting both parents' rights.

---

## Miscellaneous Rulings

### Traveling with the child:
- **Custodian's travel**: If it's a distant relocation, custody may be transferred
- **Non-custodian's travel**: Cannot take the child without the custodian's consent

### Child's maintenance:
Maintenance is the **father's responsibility** even if the child is with the mother.

### Custody wages:
The female custodian is entitled to wages taken from the child's wealth or paid by the father.
