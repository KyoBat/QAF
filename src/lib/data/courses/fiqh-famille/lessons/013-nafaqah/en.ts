# Maintenance and Alimony (An-Nafaqah)

## Definition of Nafaqah

**Linguistic meaning**: The term "nafaqah" comes from "infaq" (spending), and is only used for good purposes.

**Legal definition**: It is **providing for those under one's care with food, clothing, shelter, and related necessities**.

Allah says: {The father of the child must provide their food and clothing in a reasonable manner} [Al-Baqarah: 233]

## Legal Ruling on Maintenance

Maintenance is **obligatory** according to the Quran, Sunnah, and scholarly consensus.

The Prophet ﷺ said: «**It is sufficient sin for a person to neglect those he is supposed to feed**» [Ahmad and Abu Dawud]

And he said: «**Start with yourself, then with those you support**» [Muslim]
