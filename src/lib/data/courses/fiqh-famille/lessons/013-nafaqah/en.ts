## 🎬 Introduction

### 🎭 Scene: A Wife's Complaint

> **Hind bint 'Utbah came to the Prophet ﷺ...**
>
> She said:
>
> *"O Messenger of Allah, Abu Sufyan is a stingy man and does not give me enough for myself and my children. Can I take from his wealth without his knowledge?"*
>
> The Prophet ﷺ said:
>
> **"Take what is sufficient for you and your children, in a reasonable manner."**
>
> — **[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]**

> 🎯 **This hadith established a wife's right to take what she needs if her husband doesn't provide!**

### 🎭 Scene: The Balance

> **At the marriage counseling session...**
>
> He complained: *"She wants expensive things we can't afford!"*
>
> She complained: *"He has money but won't spend on the family!"*
>
> The counselor said:
>
> **"Islam requires him to provide according to his ability — not less, not more. And it requires her to accept what is reasonable for their situation. Both extremes are wrong."**
