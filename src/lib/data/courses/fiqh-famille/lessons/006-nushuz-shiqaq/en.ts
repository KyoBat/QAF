# Marital Discord (Nushuz and Shiqaq)

## Introduction

Married life may go through problems and disagreements. Islam has established a wise methodology for dealing with these problems, starting with advice and admonition, and ending with arbitration and reconciliation.

Allah says: **"If you fear a breach between the two, send an arbitrator from his family and an arbitrator from her family. If they desire reconciliation, Allah will bring them together"** [An-Nisa: 35]

## The Wife's Nushuz

### Signs of the Wife's Nushuz

1. **Refusing the marital bed** without a legal excuse
2. **Leaving the house** without his permission without necessity
3. **Disobedience** in what is proper
4. **Bad treatment** and insults
5. **Admitting those he dislikes** into his house

### Stages of Treating the Wife's Nushuz

Allah says: **"Those whose nushuz you fear, advise them, forsake them in bed, and strike them"** [An-Nisa: 34]

#### First Stage: Admonition

- Reminding her of Allah and legal rights
- Reminding her of the consequences of nushuz
- Calm dialogue and advice

**Conditions of admonition:**
- That it be with kindness
- Away from insults and harm
- At the appropriate time

#### Second Stage: Forsaking in Bed

- Turning away from her in bed
- Not having relations with her while staying in the house
- Forsaking in speech (maximum three days)

**Rules of forsaking:**
- That it be in the house, not outside
- That it not exceed a reasonable limit
- That it be with the intention of reform

#### Third Stage: Non-Violent Striking

**Conditions of striking:**
| Condition | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Non-violent | Does not break bones or cause wounds |
| Avoid the face | As the Prophet ﷺ said: "Do not strike the face" |
| For discipline, not revenge | The goal is reform |
| After failure of previous stages | Last resort |

**The Prophet ﷺ said:** **"The best of you do not strike"** [Reported by Abu Dawud]

**Important note:** Striking is neither recommended nor required; it is a concession for exceptional cases, and it is better to avoid it.

5. **Humiliating her** in front of people

### Treatment of the Husband's Nushuz

Allah says: **"And if a woman fears from her husband nushuz or turning away, there is no sin upon them if they make a settlement between them, and settlement is better"** [An-Nisa: 128]

**Steps of treatment:**

1. **Reconciliation**: Understanding and mutual concessions

## Discord Between Spouses (Shiqaq)

### Definition of Shiqaq

**Linguistically**: Disagreement and intense conflict.

**Legally**: Persistent conflict between spouses that raises fear of not maintaining Allah's limits.

### Causes of Shiqaq

| Bad character | From one or both spouses |
| Non-fulfillment of rights | Neglecting marital duties |
| Family interference | Negative intervention in marital life |

| Incompatibility | Differences in temperament and habits |

Allah says: **"Send an arbitrator from his family and an arbitrator from her family"** [An-Nisa: 35]

#### Conditions for the Arbitrators

1. **Justice**: That they be just
2. **Wisdom**: The ability to reconcile
3. **Knowledge**: Knowing the situation of the spouses
4. **Kinship**: It is preferable that they be from the families

#### Powers of the Arbitrators

**Scholars differ:**

| School | Opinion |
|--------|---------|
| The majority | For reconciliation only; separation requires the permission of the spouses |

**The preponderant view:** The arbitrators can do what they see as beneficial, whether uniting or separating.

#### Steps of Arbitration

1. **Choosing the arbitrators** from the families of the spouses
2. **Listening** to both parties
3. **Verifying** the causes of the conflict
4. **Attempting reconciliation** and bringing closer
