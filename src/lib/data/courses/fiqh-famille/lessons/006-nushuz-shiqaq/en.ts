>
> The counselor asked: *"How long has this been going on?"*
>
> Both: *"Years..."*
>

### 🎭 Scene: The Prophet's ﷺ Patience

> **When the Prophet ﷺ faced difficulties with his wives...**

## ⚠️ Important Clarifications

### What Islam Does NOT Allow

| Misconception | Reality |
|---------------|---------|
| ❌ "Islam allows wife-beating" | Only symbolic, last resort, most scholars say avoid |
| ❌ "Husband can do whatever he wants" | He has limits and responsibilities |
| ❌ "Wife must obey in everything" | Only in ma'ruf (reasonable matters) |
| ❌ "She has no recourse" | She has multiple options |

### The Prophet's ﷺ Standard

> When asked about the wife's rights, the Prophet ﷺ said:
>
> **"That you feed her when you eat, clothe her when you clothe yourself, do not strike the face, do not insult her, and do not forsake her except within the home."**
>
> — **[Abu Dawud]**

---

## 💭 Reflection

> **Imam Ibn Taymiyyah** — may Allah have mercy on him — said:
>
> **"The basis of marriage is partnership and companionship, not mastery and servitude."**

> 🎯 **Conflict is inevitable — how we handle it defines whether the marriage survives!**
