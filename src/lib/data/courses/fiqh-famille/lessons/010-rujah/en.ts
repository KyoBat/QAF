# Resumption of Marriage (Ar-Raj'ah)

## Definition of Raj'ah

**Linguistic meaning**: The term raj'ah means "return" in Arabic.

**Legal definition**: Returning the divorced wife to the marriage during the waiting period ('iddah) following a non-final divorce, without a new marriage contract.

## Legal Basis

### From the Quran

Allah says: **﴾Their husbands have more right to take them back within that period if they desire reconciliation﴿** [Al-Baqarah: 228]

And He says: **﴾Divorce is twice. Then either keep her in an acceptable manner or release her with good treatment﴿** [Al-Baqarah: 229]

### From the Sunnah

Ibn 'Umar reported that he divorced his wife while she was menstruating, and the Prophet ﷺ commanded him to take her back. [Bukhari and Muslim]

## Ruling on Raj'ah

Raj'ah is **permissible** by default, but may be:

- **Recommended**: If he regrets the divorce and wants reconciliation
- **Disliked**: If his intention is to harm her
- **Forbidden**: If his goal is to extend the 'iddah to harm her

Allah says: **﴾Do not retain them to harm them in order to transgress﴿** [Al-Baqarah: 231]

## Conditions for Valid Raj'ah

### 1. The divorce must be revocable
Meaning less than three divorces, after consummation, and without compensation.

### 2. The resumption must occur during 'iddah
If the 'iddah has ended, she becomes finally separated and no resumption is possible.

### 3. The divorce must not be for compensation
If it was khul' (divorce for compensation), it is irrevocable.

### 4. It must not be the third divorce
The third divorce results in major final separation.

## Difference Between Revocable and Irrevocable Divorce

| Revocable Divorce | Irrevocable Divorce |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| First and second after consummation | Third, or before consummation, or with compensation |
| Marriage continues during 'iddah | Marriage ends immediately |
| Resumption without contract | Requires a new contract |
| Right to maintenance and housing | Minor separation grants housing only |

## Formula of Raj'ah

### I. Verbal resumption

It is valid with any expression indicating resumption, such as:

- "I take you back"
- "I return you"
- "I retain you"
- "I restore you to my custody"

### II. Resumption by action

Scholars differ on the validity of resumption by action (such as intercourse):

| School | Ruling |
|--------|--------|
| Hanafis | Valid by action absolutely |
| Malikis | Valid by action with intention |
| Shafi'is | Not valid except by words |
| Hanbalis | Valid by action absolutely |

## Witnessing the Raj'ah

### Ruling on witnessing

Allah says: **﴾And bring two just witnesses from among you﴿** [At-Talaq: 2]

| School | Ruling |
|--------|--------|
| Hanafis, Malikis, Hanbalis | Recommended |
| Shafi'is | Obligatory |

### Benefits of witnessing

- Documentation of the resumption
- Prevention of denial by either spouse
- Informing the public of the restored marriage

## Effects of Raj'ah

### 1. Restoration of marital rights
- Intimacy becomes lawful again
- Maintenance and housing become obligatory
- Mutual inheritance is established

### 2. Divorce count remains
Resumption does not cancel the previous divorce; he retains whatever remains of the three.

### 3. Wife's consent is not required
Raj'ah is the husband's right that requires neither the wife's agreement nor her guardian's.

## Issues Related to Raj'ah

### 1. Informing the wife of resumption
It is **recommended** to inform her so she knows her status, but the resumption is valid even without informing her.

### 2. Resumption after 'iddah ends
If the 'iddah is over, there is no resumption possible; a new contract and new dowry are needed.

### 3. Spouses' disagreement about resumption
If he claims he resumed during 'iddah and she denies it:
- **His word prevails** if she is still in 'iddah
- **Her word prevails** if she claims the 'iddah has ended

### 4. Conditional resumption
Conditional resumption is not valid, such as saying: "If your father comes, I will take you back."

## Woman's Rights in Raj'ah

Although raj'ah is the husband's right, Islamic law has preserved the woman's rights:

1. **Protection from harm**: Resumption to cause harm is prohibited
2. **End of 'iddah**: When it ends, she becomes master of her own destiny
3. **Right to khul'**: She can ransom herself from the marriage
4. **Judicial recourse**: She can bring her case to the judge if harmed

## Consequences of No Raj'ah

If the 'iddah ends without resumption:

1. **She becomes finally separated** (minor separation)
2. **He may marry her** with a new contract and new dowry
3. **She returns to him** with the remaining divorces
4. **She may marry** another man

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf

### Umar ibn al-Khattab Takes Back What is Right

It is reported that Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) divorced his wife Umm Kulthum bint Ali (may Allah be pleased with them both). She passed by him while in her 'iddah as he was on his way to the mosque.

Umm Kulthum said to him: **"O Commander of the Faithful, you divorced me and I would like you to take me back."**

Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: **"I have taken you back."** And he called witnesses to that.

Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) was present and said: **"He has taken her back and witnessed."**

**The lesson:** Raj'ah is the husband's right during the 'iddah, and there may be much good in it. Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) did not let pride prevent him from returning when the benefit became clear to him. Witnessing preserves rights and prevents disputes.

### The Story of Ka'b ibn Malik

When Allah's acceptance of repentance descended upon Ka'b ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) after he had stayed behind from the Tabuk expedition, the Prophet ﷺ had commanded the Muslims to avoid the three who remained behind, until he commanded Ka'b to avoid his wife.

Ka'b said: I told my wife: **"Go to your family and stay with them until Allah decides this matter."**

When the bearer of good news came with the acceptance of his repentance, the first thing he did was take his wife back, and the Muslims rejoiced at Allah's acceptance of their repentance.

**The lesson:** Even in the most difficult times, family remains a source of comfort. Ka'b's return to his wife immediately upon the acceptance of his repentance shows the value of the wife in a man's life.

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### Case One: Resumption Without the Wife's Knowledge

**Question:** I divorced my wife, then took her back in my heart without informing her. Is the resumption valid?

**Answer:** The resumption is valid even if the wife does not know, but she must be informed so she does not act as if divorced. Witnessing is recommended to preserve rights and prevent later disputes.

---

### Case Two: 'Iddah Ending Before Resumption

**Question:** I divorced my wife then traveled, and when I returned after four months wanting to take her back, she said her 'iddah had ended. What do I do?

**Answer:** If the 'iddah has ended, she has become finally separated from you (minor separation). You may marry her with a new contract and new dowry with her consent and her guardian's consent. She returns to you with the remaining divorces.

---

### Case Three: Resumption by Intercourse

**Question:** I divorced my wife then had intercourse with her during the 'iddah without saying "I take you back." Is this a valid resumption?

**Answer:** Scholars differ:
- **The majority (Hanafis, Malikis, Hanbalis):** Resumption by action is valid
- **Shafi'is:** It is not valid except by words

The safer approach is to say "I take you back" and witness, to exit the disagreement.

---

### Case Four: Resumption for Harm

**Question:** My husband divorces me then takes me back days before the 'iddah ends, and he repeats this to prolong my suffering. What is the ruling?

**Answer:** This is harmful retention which Allah has forbidden: **﴾Do not retain them to harm them in order to transgress﴿**. Bring your case to the Islamic judge to prevent him from resuming or to divorce you from him.

---

### Case Five: Resumption After the Third Divorce

**Question:** I divorced my wife three separate times, and now we want to reunite. Is this possible?

**Answer:** She is not lawful for you until she marries another husband with a valid marriage who consummates with her, then divorces her or dies, then her 'iddah from him ends. Then you may marry her with a new contract. The marriage of tahlil (pre-arranged) is forbidden and void.

---

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

**Question for reflection:**

Raj'ah is a door Allah opened for reconciliation, so why do many husbands delay resumption until the 'iddah ends? Reflect on:

1. **Pride and stubbornness:** Is self-dignity worth losing the family?
2. **Negative family interference:** How many families broke up because of "Don't take her back, you're a man"?
3. **Not appreciating consequences:** Imagine your children after a year of divorce, was the disagreement worth it?

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"The most hated of lawful things to Allah is divorce"** - so resumption is more beloved to Allah than completing the separation.

---

## Conclusion

Raj'ah is a facilitation from Allah for the husband to take back his wife during 'iddah without needing a new contract. It is valid by words unanimously, and by action according to the majority. Witnessing is recommended, and the wife's consent is not required. Islamic law has prohibited resumption for harm and has made the end of 'iddah the limit of the husband's right to resumption.
