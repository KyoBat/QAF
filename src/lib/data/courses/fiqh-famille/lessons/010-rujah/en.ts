# Resumption of Marriage (Ar-Raj'ah)

## Definition of Raj'ah

**Linguistic meaning**: The term raj'ah means "return" in Arabic.

**Legal definition**: Returning the divorced wife to the marriage during the waiting period ('iddah) following a non-final divorce, without a new marriage contract.

## Legal Basis

### From the Quran

Allah says: **﴾Their husbands have more right to take them back within that period if they desire reconciliation﴿** [Al-Baqarah: 228]

And He says: **﴾Divorce is twice. Then either keep her in an acceptable manner or release her with good treatment﴿** [Al-Baqarah: 229]

### From the Sunnah

Ibn 'Umar reported that he divorced his wife while she was menstruating, and the Prophet ﷺ commanded him to take her back. [Bukhari and Muslim]

## Ruling on Raj'ah

Raj'ah is **permissible** by default, but may be:

- **Recommended**: If he regrets the divorce and wants reconciliation
- **Disliked**: If his intention is to harm her
- **Forbidden**: If his goal is to extend the 'iddah to harm her

Allah says: **﴾Do not retain them to harm them in order to transgress﴿** [Al-Baqarah: 231]

## Conditions for Valid Raj'ah

### 1. The divorce must be revocable
Meaning less than three divorces, after consummation, and without compensation.

### 2. The resumption must occur during 'iddah
If the 'iddah has ended, she becomes finally separated and no resumption is possible.

### 3. The divorce must not be for compensation
If it was khul' (divorce for compensation), it is irrevocable.

### 4. It must not be the third divorce
The third divorce results in major final separation.

## Difference Between Revocable and Irrevocable Divorce

| Revocable Divorce | Irrevocable Divorce |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| First and second after consummation | Third, or before consummation, or with compensation |
| Marriage continues during 'iddah | Marriage ends immediately |
| Resumption without contract | Requires a new contract |
| Right to maintenance and housing | Minor separation grants housing only |

## Formula of Raj'ah

### I. Verbal resumption

It is valid with any expression indicating resumption, such as:

- "I take you back"
- "I return you"
- "I retain you"
- "I restore you to my custody"

### II. Resumption by action

Scholars differ on the validity of resumption by action (such as intercourse):

| School | Ruling |
|--------|--------|
| Hanafis | Valid by action absolutely |
| Malikis | Valid by action with intention |
| Shafi'is | Not valid except by words |
| Hanbalis | Valid by action absolutely |

## Witnessing the Raj'ah

### Ruling on witnessing

Allah says: **﴾And bring two just witnesses from among you﴿** [At-Talaq: 2]

| School | Ruling |
|--------|--------|
| Hanafis, Malikis, Hanbalis | Recommended |
| Shafi'is | Obligatory |

### Benefits of witnessing

- Documentation of the resumption
- Prevention of denial by either spouse
- Informing the public of the restored marriage

## Effects of Raj'ah

### 1. Restoration of marital rights
- Intimacy becomes lawful again
- Maintenance and housing become obligatory
- Mutual inheritance is established

### 2. Divorce count remains
Resumption does not cancel the previous divorce; he retains whatever remains of the three.

### 3. Wife's consent is not required
Raj'ah is the husband's right that requires neither the wife's agreement nor her guardian's.

## Issues Related to Raj'ah

### 1. Informing the wife of resumption
It is **recommended** to inform her so she knows her status, but the resumption is valid even without informing her.

### 2. Resumption after 'iddah ends
If the 'iddah is over, there is no resumption possible; a new contract and new dowry are needed.

### 3. Spouses' disagreement about resumption
If he claims he resumed during 'iddah and she denies it:
- **His word prevails** if she is still in 'iddah
- **Her word prevails** if she claims the 'iddah has ended

### 4. Conditional resumption
Conditional resumption is not valid, such as saying: "If your father comes, I will take you back."

## Woman's Rights in Raj'ah

Although raj'ah is the husband's right, Islamic law has preserved the woman's rights:

1. **Protection from harm**: Resumption to cause harm is prohibited
2. **End of 'iddah**: When it ends, she becomes master of her own destiny
3. **Right to khul'**: She can ransom herself from the marriage
4. **Judicial recourse**: She can bring her case to the judge if harmed

## Consequences of No Raj'ah

If the 'iddah ends without resumption:

1. **She becomes finally separated** (minor separation)
2. **He may marry her** with a new contract and new dowry
3. **She returns to him** with the remaining divorces
4. **She may marry** another man

## Conclusion

Raj'ah is a facilitation from Allah for the husband to take back his wife during 'iddah without needing a new contract. It is valid by words unanimously, and by action according to the majority. Witnessing is recommended, and the wife's consent is not required. Islamic law has prohibited resumption for harm and has made the end of 'iddah the limit of the husband's right to resumption.
