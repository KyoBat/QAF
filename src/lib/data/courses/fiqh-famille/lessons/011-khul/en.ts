# Khul' (Wife-Initiated Divorce)

## Definition of Khul'

**Linguistic meaning**: The term khul' means "to remove" or "take off" in Arabic, like removing a garment. It is called this because the woman "removes" herself from her husband as one removes clothing.

**Legal definition**: The separation of the husband from his wife in exchange for compensation he receives from her or from a third party, using specific terms.

## Legal Basis

### From the Quran

Allah says: **﴾If you fear that they will not be able to keep the limits ordained by Allah, then there is no sin on either of them if she gives something for her freedom﴿** [Al-Baqarah: 229]

### From the Sunnah

Ibn Abbas reported that the wife of Thabit ibn Qays came to the Prophet ﷺ and said: "O Messenger of Allah, I do not blame Thabit ibn Qays for any defect in his character or religion, but I fear falling into disbelief in Islam." The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: **"Will you return his garden to him?"** She said: "Yes." He said: **"Accept the garden and divorce her once"** [Reported by Bukhari]

## Ruling on Khul'

Khul' is **permissible** when needed, and its rulings vary:

| Situation | Ruling |
|-----------|--------|
| She dislikes him without fault on his part | Permissible |
| He harms her so she ransoms herself | Forbidden for the husband |
| Fear of not observing Allah's limits | Recommended |
| No real need | Disliked |

## Conditions for Valid Khul'

### 1. Husband's capacity to divorce
He must be mature, sane, and willing.

### 2. Acceptance of compensation
There must be compensation offered by the wife or a third party.

### 3. Woman's capacity to dispose of her wealth
She must be legally competent to manage her property.

### 4. Existence of valid marriage
There must be a valid marriage contract between them.

## Pillars of Khul'

1. **The husband**: Who accepts the compensation and separates from his wife
2. **The wife**: Who offers the compensation
3. **The compensation**: What the wife gives in exchange for separation
4. **The formula**: The words indicating khul'

## Compensation in Khul'

### What can serve as compensation

- **The dowry**: All or part of it
- **Money**: Any valuable property
- **Services**: Such as nursing or caring for the child
- **Waiving a right**: Such as giving up the 'iddah maintenance

### Amount of compensation

| School | Ruling |
|--------|--------|
| Majority | Can be less or more than the dowry |
| Hanbalis (one opinion) | Disliked to exceed the dowry |

**Evidence**: His ﷺ saying: **"Will you return his garden to him?"** The garden was her dowry.

## Formulas of Khul'

### Explicit formulas
- "I release you (khul') for such amount"
- "I ransom you for such amount"
- "You have ransomed yourself from me for such amount"

### Implicit formulas
These require intention, such as:
- "You are irrevocably separated for such amount"
- "Your matter is in your hands for such amount"

## Difference Between Khul' and Talaq

| Khul' | Talaq |
|-------|-------|
| With compensation from the wife | Without compensation |
| Requires her consent | Does not require her consent |
| Requested by the wife | Initiated by the husband |
| Irrevocable without possibility of return | May be revocable |
| Correct view: it's an annulment that doesn't count | Decreases the divorce count |

## Is Khul' a Divorce or an Annulment?

Scholars differ on this:

| View | Proponents | Effect |
|------|------------|--------|
| Irrevocable divorce | Hanafis, Malikis, Shafi'is | Decreases divorce count |
| Annulment | Ibn Abbas, Ahmad, Ibn Taymiyyah | Does not decrease divorce count |

**Preponderant view**: It is an annulment that does not decrease the divorce count, because Allah says: **﴾Divorce is twice﴿** then mentions khul' then says: **﴾If he divorces her [again], she shall not be lawful to him﴿** making the prohibiting divorce the third one after khul'.

## Waiting Period of the Woman Who Made Khul'

Scholars differ:

| View | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| Three menstrual cycles | By analogy with divorced women |
| One menstrual cycle | Hadith of Ibn Abbas: "He commanded her to observe a waiting period of one menstruation" |

## Rules Related to Khul'

### 1. Khul' during menstruation
Khul' is **valid** during menstruation because the prohibition of divorce is for her benefit, and she is the one requesting it.

### 2. Khul' of pregnant woman
The khul' of a pregnant woman is **valid**, and her 'iddah ends at delivery.

### 3. Conditional khul'
Conditional khul' is **valid**, such as saying: "If you give me such amount, you are free."

### 4. Khul' for children's expenses
It is **valid** for the compensation to be taking responsibility for the children.

### 5. Proxy for khul'
A woman **may** authorize someone to negotiate khul' on her behalf.

## Cases Where Khul' Is Not Valid

### 1. Husband coercing her for khul'
If he coerces her or harms her so she ransoms herself, the khul' is void and the money must be returned.

Allah says: **﴾Do not prevent them from remarrying in order to take back part of what you have given them﴿** [An-Nisa: 19]

### 2. Khul' of an incapable woman
The khul' of a spendthrift woman is not valid because she lacks capacity to dispose of her wealth.

### 3. Khul' of terminally ill woman
If a terminally ill woman makes khul' for more than the husband's inheritance share, the excess is taken from the third.

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf

### The Wife of Thabit ibn Qays - The First Khul' in Islam

**Jamila bint Abdullah ibn Ubayy** - some say her name was Habiba - was the wife of Thabit ibn Qays ibn Shammas, the orator of the Ansar and one of the distinguished Companions.

She came to the Prophet ﷺ on a dark day, while people were waiting for the Fajr prayer, and said with complete fairness and honesty:

> **"O Messenger of Allah! Thabit ibn Qays - I do not blame him for any defect in character or religion, but I fear falling into disbelief in Islam!"**

How beautiful is this fairness! She did not accuse him of bad character, nor did she attack his religion, but she honestly admitted that she could not be a good wife to him, and feared that staying with him would lead to her falling short in his rights.

The Prophet ﷺ asked her: **"Will you return his garden to him?"** - for he had given her a garden of palm trees as her dowry.

She said: **"Yes, and more!"**

He ﷺ said: **"As for the extra, no. But the garden."**

Then he told Thabit: **"Accept the garden and divorce her once."**

He did so. Thus khul' was legislated in Islam, to be a legal exit for a woman who cannot bear life with her husband.

**The lesson**: Islam preserved the woman's right to exit a marriage she cannot continue in, while being fair to the man by returning what he gave her.

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### Case One: Wife Wants Khul' Due to Incompatibility

**Question:** Sarah has been married for five years. Her husband is a righteous man who prays and works, but she feels incompatible with him and cannot love him despite her attempts. May she request khul'?

**Answer:** Yes, she may request khul'. This case is exactly like that of the wife of Thabit ibn Qays. She did not fault him in his religion or character, but she cannot stay with him. Khul' is legislated for such cases, and she returns his dowry or what they agree upon.

---

### Case Two: Husband Refuses Khul'

**Question:** Khadija wants khul' from her husband and offered to return the full dowry, but he refuses and says: "I will not divorce you even if you pay millions." What is the solution?

**Answer:** If the husband refuses khul' unjustly, the wife has the right to bring her case to the Islamic judge. The judge may rule for khul' if he finds her request genuine and the husband obstinate. Some scholars say: The judge compels the husband to accept khul' if the woman is harmed and has a right to it.

---

### Case Three: Khul' with Giving Up Child Custody

**Question:** Amira requested khul', but her husband made it conditional on giving up custody of her three children. Is this condition valid?

**Answer:** Custody is the child's right, not just the mother's. A condition that takes children from their mother is not valid if she is fit for custody. This condition harms the children. The compensation for khul' may be taking on the children's expenses or part of them, but the mother's right to custody does not fall if she is qualified for it.

---

### Case Four: Khul' for More Than the Dowry

**Question:** Hind's husband gave her a dowry of 10,000, and now he is asking her for 50,000 to agree to khul'. Is this permissible?

**Answer:** Scholars differ on this. The majority view is that it is permissible but disliked. It is better that he not take more than he gave her. The Prophet ﷺ said when the woman wanted to return the garden and more: **"As for the extra, no."** So the Sunnah is that he takes only what he gave.

---

### Case Five: Husband Harms Her to Make Her Request Khul'

**Question:** Noura's husband mistreats and insults her daily, then tells her: "If you want peace, pay and leave." What should she do?

**Answer:** This is forbidden coercion. If he harms her so she ransoms herself, then the khul' in this case is **void**, the money is returned to her, and she is divorced without compensation. Allah says: **﴾Do not prevent them from remarrying in order to take back part of what you have given them﴿**. She must bring her case to the court.

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

> If you were an Islamic judge, and a woman came to you requesting khul' while her husband refuses, and both appear sincere in their positions... how would you balance between the woman's right to exit a marriage she cannot bear, and the man's right to keep his wife? And what is the wisdom in the Sharia making an exit for the woman in exchange for money, while the man has divorce without compensation?

---

## Cases Where Khul' Is Not Valid

### 1. Husband coercing her for khul'
If he coerces her or harms her so she ransoms herself, the khul' is void and the money must be returned.

Allah says: **﴾Do not prevent them from remarrying in order to take back part of what you have given them﴿** [An-Nisa: 19]

### 2. Khul' of an incapable woman
The khul' of a spendthrift woman is not valid because she lacks capacity to dispose of her wealth.

### 3. Khul' of terminally ill woman
If a terminally ill woman makes khul' for more than the husband's inheritance share, the excess is taken from the third.

## Rights of the Woman Who Made Khul'

1. **No maintenance** during 'iddah unless pregnant
2. **No housing** according to the majority
3. **She may be entitled to a gift** according to some scholars
4. **Raising her children** is not affected by khul'

## Conclusion

Khul' is the wife's ransom from her marriage in exchange for compensation. It is legitimate when needed, and the preponderant view is that it is an annulment that does not decrease the divorce count. Islamic law has forbidden coercing the woman into khul', while granting her this right when she cannot bear married life and fears not being able to observe Allah's limits.
