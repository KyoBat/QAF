## 🎬 Introduction

### 🎭 Scene: A Woman's Distress

> **In the Prophet's ﷺ time...**
>
> **Jamila bint Salul** came to the Prophet ﷺ:
>
> *"O Messenger of Allah, I do not criticize Thabit ibn Qays in his character or his religion, but I dislike disbelief (being ungrateful) in Islam."*
>
> The Prophet ﷺ asked: *"Will you return his garden (the mahr) to him?"*
>
> She said: *"Yes."*
>
> So the Prophet ﷺ said to Thabit:
>
> **"Accept the garden and divorce her once."**
>
> — **[Al-Bukhari]**

> 🎯 **Islam gave women an exit when the marriage no longer works!**

---

### 🎭 Scene: Understanding the Difference

> **A woman asked the scholar...**
>
> *"What's the difference between khul' and regular divorce?"*
>
> The scholar explained:
>
> **"In regular divorce, the husband initiates and she keeps her mahr.**
>
> **In khul', you initiate by asking for divorce and returning something (usually the mahr) to gain your freedom."**
>
> She asked: *"Can he refuse?"*
>
> The scholar said:
>
> **"Scholars differ — but if the situation is harmful, a judge can order it even without his consent."**

> 💡 **Khul' is a woman's door to freedom when marriage becomes unbearable!**

## 🤔 Does He Have to Accept?

### The Disagreement

|------|----------|
| 🔵 Majority | He must agree for khul' |
| 🟢 Ibn Taymiyyah | Judge can force it if she suffers harm |
| ⚖️ Modern practice | Many countries allow court-ordered khul' |

### Evidence for Court-Ordered Khul'

> The Prophet ﷺ ordered Thabit:
>
> **"Accept the garden and divorce her once."**

| Some scholars say | This was a command, not a request |

## 📊 The 'Iddah of Khul'

| 🔵 Majority | Three quru' (like regular divorce) |

## 📜 Effect on Divorce Count

### The Debate

| View | Effect |
|------|--------|
| 🔵 Some scholars | Khul' is a divorce (counts as one) |
| 🟢 Others | Khul' is faskh (annulment, doesn't count) |

### Practical Difference
