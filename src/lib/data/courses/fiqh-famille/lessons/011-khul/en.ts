# Khul' (Wife-Initiated Divorce)

## Definition of Khul'

**Linguistic meaning**: The term khul' means "to remove" or "take off" in Arabic, like removing a garment. It is called this because the woman "removes" herself from her husband as one removes clothing.

**Legal definition**: The separation of the husband from his wife in exchange for compensation he receives from her or from a third party, using specific terms.

## Legal Basis

### From the Quran

Allah says: **﴾If you fear that they will not be able to keep the limits ordained by Allah, then there is no sin on either of them if she gives something for her freedom﴿** [Al-Baqarah: 229]

### From the Sunnah

Ibn Abbas reported that the wife of Thabit ibn Qays came to the Prophet ﷺ and said: "O Messenger of Allah, I do not blame Thabit ibn Qays for any defect in his character or religion, but I fear falling into disbelief in Islam." The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: **"Will you return his garden to him?"** She said: "Yes." He said: **"Accept the garden and divorce her once"** [Reported by Bukhari]

## Ruling on Khul'

Khul' is **permissible** when needed, and its rulings vary:

| Situation | Ruling |
|-----------|--------|
| She dislikes him without fault on his part | Permissible |
| He harms her so she ransoms herself | Forbidden for the husband |
| Fear of not observing Allah's limits | Recommended |
| No real need | Disliked |

## Conditions for Valid Khul'

### 1. Husband's capacity to divorce
He must be mature, sane, and willing.

### 2. Acceptance of compensation
There must be compensation offered by the wife or a third party.

### 3. Woman's capacity to dispose of her wealth
She must be legally competent to manage her property.

### 4. Existence of valid marriage
There must be a valid marriage contract between them.

## Pillars of Khul'

1. **The husband**: Who accepts the compensation and separates from his wife
2. **The wife**: Who offers the compensation
3. **The compensation**: What the wife gives in exchange for separation
4. **The formula**: The words indicating khul'

## Compensation in Khul'

### What can serve as compensation

- **The dowry**: All or part of it
- **Money**: Any valuable property
- **Services**: Such as nursing or caring for the child
- **Waiving a right**: Such as giving up the 'iddah maintenance

### Amount of compensation

| School | Ruling |
|--------|--------|
| Majority | Can be less or more than the dowry |
| Hanbalis (one opinion) | Disliked to exceed the dowry |

**Evidence**: His ﷺ saying: **"Will you return his garden to him?"** The garden was her dowry.

## Formulas of Khul'

### Explicit formulas
- "I release you (khul') for such amount"
- "I ransom you for such amount"
- "You have ransomed yourself from me for such amount"

### Implicit formulas
These require intention, such as:
- "You are irrevocably separated for such amount"
- "Your matter is in your hands for such amount"

## Difference Between Khul' and Talaq

| Khul' | Talaq |
|-------|-------|
| With compensation from the wife | Without compensation |
| Requires her consent | Does not require her consent |
| Requested by the wife | Initiated by the husband |
| Irrevocable without possibility of return | May be revocable |
| Correct view: it's an annulment that doesn't count | Decreases the divorce count |

## Is Khul' a Divorce or an Annulment?

Scholars differ on this:

| View | Proponents | Effect |
|------|------------|--------|
| Irrevocable divorce | Hanafis, Malikis, Shafi'is | Decreases divorce count |
| Annulment | Ibn Abbas, Ahmad, Ibn Taymiyyah | Does not decrease divorce count |

**Preponderant view**: It is an annulment that does not decrease the divorce count, because Allah says: **﴾Divorce is twice﴿** then mentions khul' then says: **﴾If he divorces her [again], she shall not be lawful to him﴿** making the prohibiting divorce the third one after khul'.

## Waiting Period of the Woman Who Made Khul'

Scholars differ:

| View | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| Three menstrual cycles | By analogy with divorced women |
| One menstrual cycle | Hadith of Ibn Abbas: "He commanded her to observe a waiting period of one menstruation" |

## Rules Related to Khul'

### 1. Khul' during menstruation
Khul' is **valid** during menstruation because the prohibition of divorce is for her benefit, and she is the one requesting it.

### 2. Khul' of pregnant woman
The khul' of a pregnant woman is **valid**, and her 'iddah ends at delivery.

### 3. Conditional khul'
Conditional khul' is **valid**, such as saying: "If you give me such amount, you are free."

### 4. Khul' for children's expenses
It is **valid** for the compensation to be taking responsibility for the children.

### 5. Proxy for khul'
A woman **may** authorize someone to negotiate khul' on her behalf.

## Cases Where Khul' Is Not Valid

### 1. Husband coercing her for khul'
If he coerces her or harms her so she ransoms herself, the khul' is void and the money must be returned.

Allah says: **﴾Do not prevent them from remarrying in order to take back part of what you have given them﴿** [An-Nisa: 19]

### 2. Khul' of an incapable woman
The khul' of a spendthrift woman is not valid because she lacks capacity to dispose of her wealth.

### 3. Khul' of terminally ill woman
If a terminally ill woman makes khul' for more than the husband's inheritance share, the excess is taken from the third.

## Rights of the Woman Who Made Khul'

1. **No maintenance** during 'iddah unless pregnant
2. **No housing** according to the majority
3. **She may be entitled to a gift** according to some scholars
4. **Raising her children** is not affected by khul'

## Conclusion

Khul' is the wife's ransom from her marriage in exchange for compensation. It is legitimate when needed, and the preponderant view is that it is an annulment that does not decrease the divorce count. Islamic law has forbidden coercing the woman into khul', while granting her this right when she cannot bear married life and fears not being able to observe Allah's limits.
