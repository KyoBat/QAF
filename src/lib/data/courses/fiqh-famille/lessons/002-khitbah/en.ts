# Engagement in Islam

## Definition of Engagement (Khitbah)

Linguistically: Asking a woman for marriage.
Legally: Expressing the desire to marry a specific woman and informing her family of this.

## Legitimacy of Engagement

### From the Quran

Allah says: **"There is no blame upon you for that to which you allude concerning a proposal to women"** [Al-Baqarah: 235]

### From the Prophetic Sunnah

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"When one of you proposes to a woman, if he can look at what would encourage him to marry her, let him do so"** [Reported by Abu Dawud]

## Ruling on Engagement

Engagement is recommended (mandoub) before marriage. It is a preliminary step to marriage and not a binding contract.

## Etiquettes of Engagement

### 1. Looking at the Fiancée

The suitor is permitted to look at what would encourage him to marry her, such as the face and hands.

**Conditions for Looking:**
- Having sincere intention of marriage
- Being in the presence of a mahram (guardian)
- Limiting to what achieves the purpose

### 2. Indirect Proposal for Women in Waiting Period

Allah says: **"There is no blame upon you for that to which you allude concerning a proposal to women or for what you conceal within yourselves"** [Al-Baqarah: 235]

### 3. Istikhara and Consultation

It is recommended for the suitor to perform the prayer of guidance (istikhara) and consult experienced people before proceeding.

## What is Prohibited in Engagement

### 1. Proposing Over Another's Proposal

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"A man should not propose to a woman who is already proposed to by his brother, until he marries her or withdraws"** [Bukhari and Muslim]

### 2. Being Alone with the Fiancée

The fiancée remains a stranger to her suitor until the marriage contract is concluded, so seclusion with her is not permitted.

### 3. Explicit Proposal to a Woman in Waiting Period

It is not permissible to explicitly propose to a woman in her waiting period from death or irrevocable divorce.

## Recommended Qualities in a Fiancée

| Quality | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Religion and character | "Choose the religious one, you will prosper" |
| Fertility | "Marry the loving and fertile women" |
| Virginity | "Why not a virgin whom you can play with and she plays with you" |
| Beauty | It is permissible to look at her before engagement |
| Noble lineage | Part of the considered compatibility |

## Breaking the Engagement

### Ruling on Breaking

Both parties may break the engagement because it is a promise and not a contract.

### Ruling on Dowry and Gifts

- **The dowry**: Must be returned in full if it was given
- **Gifts**: Scholars differ, but the preponderant view is that they should be returned if given because of the engagement

## Effects of Engagement

1. Marital rulings do not apply to engagement
2. The fiancée remains a stranger to her suitor
3. Either party may break the engagement
4. No obligation for maintenance or housing

## Lesson Summary

- Engagement is a legitimate preliminary step to marriage
- Looking at the fiancée is permitted within specific guidelines
- Proposing over another's proposal and seclusion with the fiancée are prohibited
- Breaking the engagement is permissible for both parties
