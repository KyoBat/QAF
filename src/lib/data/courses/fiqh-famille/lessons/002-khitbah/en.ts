## 📖 Stories from the Companions: The Engagement of Julaybib (may Allah be pleased with him)

**Julaybib** (may Allah be pleased with him) was a poor Companion, short in stature, with no known lineage among his people. The Prophet ﷺ wanted to find him a wife, so he went to a man from the Ansar and said:

> "Marry me your daughter."

The man said: Yes, with pleasure, O Messenger of Allah.

The Prophet ﷺ said: "I do not want her for myself."

He said: Then for whom, O Messenger of Allah?

He said: "For Julaybib."

The man went to his wife, who said: For Julaybib?! No, by Allah!

**But the daughter heard the conversation and said:**

> "Are you rejecting the command of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ? Give me to him, for he will not let me down."

So the Prophet ﷺ married her to Julaybib. He was later martyred in a battle, having killed seven of the polytheists before being killed. The Prophet ﷺ said while carrying him:

> "He is of me and I am of him."

**Lesson**: The believing woman prioritized religion over appearance and accepted the one chosen by Allah and His Messenger.

## Ruling on Engagement

Engagement is recommended (mandoub) before marriage. It is a preliminary step to marriage and not a binding contract.

## Etiquettes of Engagement

### 1. Looking at the Fiancée

The suitor is permitted to look at what would encourage him to marry her, such as the face and hands.

**Conditions for Looking:**
- Having sincere intention of marriage
- Being in the presence of a mahram (guardian)
- Limiting to what achieves the purpose

## 📖 From the Prophet's Biography: His Proposal to Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her)

Khawlah bint Hakim came to the Prophet ﷺ after the death of Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her) and said: Will you not marry?

He said: "Whom?"

She said: If you wish, a virgin, and if you wish, a previously married woman.

He said: "Who is the virgin?"

She said: The daughter of the one most beloved to you of Allah's creation, Aisha daughter of Abu Bakr.

**So the Prophet ﷺ proposed to her from Abu Bakr** (may Allah be pleased with him) in the proper manner.

**Benefit**: Even the Prophet ﷺ proposed in the customary way and did not bypass the guardian.

### 2. Indirect Proposal for Women in Waiting Period

Allah says: **"There is no blame upon you for that to which you allude concerning a proposal to women or for what you conceal within yourselves"** [Al-Baqarah: 235]

### 3. Istikhara and Consultation

It is recommended for the suitor to perform the prayer of guidance (istikhara) and consult experienced people before proceeding.

## What is Prohibited in Engagement

### 1. Proposing Over Another's Proposal

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"A man should not propose to a woman who is already proposed to by his brother, until he marries her or withdraws"** [Bukhari and Muslim]

### 2. Being Alone with the Fiancée

The fiancée remains a stranger to her suitor until the marriage contract is concluded, so seclusion with her is not permitted.

### 3. Explicit Proposal to a Woman in Waiting Period

It is not permissible to explicitly propose to a woman in her waiting period from death or irrevocable divorce.

## Recommended Qualities in a Fiancée

| Quality | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Religion and character | "Choose the religious one, you will prosper" |
| Fertility | "Marry the loving and fertile women" |
| Virginity | "Why not a virgin whom you can play with and she plays with you" |
| Beauty | It is permissible to look at her before engagement |
| Noble lineage | Part of the considered compatibility |

## Breaking the Engagement

### Ruling on Breaking

Both parties may break the engagement because it is a promise and not a contract.

### Ruling on Dowry and Gifts

- **The dowry**: Must be returned in full if it was given
- **Gifts**: Scholars differ, but the preponderant view is that they should be returned if given because of the engagement

## Effects of Engagement

1. Marital rulings do not apply to engagement
2. The fiancée remains a stranger to her suitor
3. Either party may break the engagement
4. No obligation for maintenance or housing

## Lesson Summary

- Engagement is a legitimate preliminary step to marriage
- Looking at the fiancée is permitted within specific guidelines
- Proposing over another's proposal and seclusion with the fiancée are prohibited
- Breaking the engagement is permissible for both parties

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

**Question for Thought**: 

You are a woman, and two suitors have proposed to you:
1. **The first**: Rich, handsome, but only prays sometimes
2. **The second**: Average means, ordinary looking, but committed to his religion

**Which one would you choose? And why?**

Remember the Prophet's ﷺ saying: **"A woman is married for four reasons: her wealth, her lineage, her beauty, and her religion. Choose the religious one, may your hands be dusty (i.e., you will prosper)."**
