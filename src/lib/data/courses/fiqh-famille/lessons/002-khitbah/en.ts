## 🎬 Introduction

### 🎭 Scene: The Proper Way

> **In a family home...**
>
> A young man came with his father to meet a family whose daughter he wished to marry.
>
> The father said: *"My son has completed his studies, has a good job, and prays regularly. He wishes to ask for your daughter's hand."*
>
> The girl's father said: *"Tell us about yourself, young man."*
>
> After the conversation, the girl was called...
>
> She sat with her mahram present, and they spoke briefly...
>
> The young man said to his father afterward:
>
> **"Father, I saw her and I'm pleased. I want to proceed."**

> 🎯 **This is the proper Islamic way — respect, transparency, and proper procedure!**

---

### 🎭 Scene: The Wrong Way

> **On social media...**
>
> A message arrives: *"Assalamu alaykum, I saw your profile. I want to get to know you for marriage."*
>
> She replies... They chat for months...
>
> Emotions develop... But no families are involved...
>
> Eventually: *"My family doesn't approve."*
>
> Hearts are broken. Haram may have occurred. Reputation is damaged.

> ⚠️ **This is not Khitbah — this is the path to fitnah!**
