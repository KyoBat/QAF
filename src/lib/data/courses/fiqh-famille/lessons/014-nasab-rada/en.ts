# Lineage and Breastfeeding (An-Nasab wa Ar-Rada')

## Part One: Lineage (An-Nasab)

### Definition of Lineage

**Linguistic meaning**: Nasab means kinship and attachment.

**Legal definition**: It is the **relationship of the child to his father that results in legal rights and obligations**.

Allah says: {It is He who created from water a human being and made for him blood-relations and marriage-relations} [Al-Furqan: 54]

### Importance of Lineage in Islam

Lineage is one of the greatest objectives of Sharia because it:

1. **Preserves bloodlines** from mixing
2. **Guarantees the rights** of children
3. **Forms the basis** for inheritance and guardianship
4. **Maintains family ties** and strengthens bonds

The Prophet ﷺ said: «**The child belongs to the marriage bed, and the fornicator gets the stone**» [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]

---

### Methods of Establishing Lineage

#### 1. Valid Marriage Bed

Valid marriage is the primary way to establish lineage.

**Conditions for establishing lineage through marriage:**
- The **minimum pregnancy duration** (six months) must have passed since the contract
- The husband must be **capable of procreation**
- The duration must not exceed the **maximum pregnancy period** (four years according to some jurists)

#### 2. Acknowledgment of Paternity

When a man acknowledges that someone is his child.

**Conditions for valid acknowledgment:**
- The acknowledged person must be of **unknown lineage**
- It must be **possible** for them to be his child
- The acknowledged person must **confirm** if they are an adult

#### 3. Testimonial Evidence

Testimony of two upright witnesses establishing lineage.

### Prohibition of Adoption in Islam

Forbidden adoption: Attributing a child to someone other than his biological father.

Allah says: {Call them by their fathers' names; that is more just in the sight of Allah} [Al-Ahzab: 5]

And He says: {Nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons} [Al-Ahzab: 4]

**What is permissible:**
- **Kafala**: Caring for and raising an orphan without changing his lineage
- **Sponsorship**: Providing for a child of unknown lineage

The Prophet ﷺ said: «**I and the guardian of the orphan will be in Paradise like this**» showing his index and middle fingers [Al-Bukhari]

---

### Prohibition of Claiming Other Than One's Father

The Prophet ﷺ said: «**Whoever claims to be the son of someone other than his father while knowing he is not his father, Paradise is forbidden for him**» [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]

And he said: «**No man claims to be the son of someone other than his father while knowing it, except that he has committed disbelief**» [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]

## Part Two: Breastfeeding (Ar-Rada')

### Definition of Prohibitive Breastfeeding

**Linguistic meaning**: Rida'a means sucking milk from the breast.

**Legal definition**: It is the **reaching of a woman's milk to a child's stomach during the breastfeeding period**.

Allah says: {And your mothers who nursed you and your sisters through nursing} [An-Nisa: 23]

### Legal Ruling on Breastfeeding

Breastfeeding **creates a relationship of mahram** (unmarriageable kin) like blood relations.

The Prophet ﷺ said: «**What is forbidden through lineage is forbidden through breastfeeding**» [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]

---

### Conditions for Prohibitive Breastfeeding

#### 1. Breastfeeding must occur within the first two years

Allah says: {Mothers shall breastfeed their children for two complete years} [Al-Baqarah: 233]

The Prophet ﷺ said: «**There is no breastfeeding except within the first two years**» [Ad-Daraqutni]

#### 2. Five or more sucklings

Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) said: «**It was revealed in the Quran: ten known sucklings make forbidden, then it was abrogated by five known sucklings**» [Muslim]

#### 3. The milk must reach the stomach

Whether through direct breastfeeding, pouring into the mouth, or through the nose.

### Women Forbidden Through Breastfeeding

What is forbidden through breastfeeding mirrors what is forbidden through lineage:

| Through Lineage | Through Breastfeeding |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Mother | Foster mother |
| Daughter | Foster daughter |
| Sister | Foster sister |
| Paternal aunt | Foster paternal aunt |
| Maternal aunt | Foster maternal aunt |
| Brother's daughter | Foster brother's daughter |
| Sister's daughter | Foster sister's daughter |

### Those Not Forbidden Through Breastfeeding

Breastfeeding does not forbid:
- **The wet nurse's mother**: Not a foster grandmother to the nursling
- **The wet nurse's sister**: Not a foster maternal aunt to the nursling
- **The nursling's biological siblings**: No prohibition between them and the wet nurse's children

> **Rule**: Breastfeeding establishes prohibition for the nursling only, not for his biological siblings.

---

### The Father's Milk (Laban Al-Fahl)

**Meaning**: The wet nurse's husband (the owner of the milk) becomes the foster father of the nursling.

**Effect**: The nursling is also forbidden from marrying this man's daughters from other wives.

**Evidence**: Aisha's narration about the story of Aflah, brother of Abu Al-Qu'ays: The Prophet ﷺ said: «**Let him in, for he is your uncle**» [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]

---

### Establishing Breastfeeding

Breastfeeding is established through:

1. **The testimony of one woman** according to some jurists
2. **The testimony of two women** according to others
3. **The wet nurse's admission** of breastfeeding

When the Prophet ﷺ was asked about a woman's testimony regarding breastfeeding, he said: «**Yes**» [Al-Bukhari]

---

### Miscellaneous Rulings

#### Child's right to breastfeeding
Breastfeeding is the child's right from his mother during the first two years.

#### Wages for breastfeeding
The wet nurse is entitled to wages if she breastfeeds a child other than her own.

Allah says: {If they breastfeed for you, give them their wages} [At-Talaq: 6]

#### Milk banks
Contemporary scholars differ on this issue, and it is more cautious to avoid them to preserve the clarity of lineages.

## Wisdom Behind the Rules of Lineage and Breastfeeding

1. **Preserving lineages** from mixing
2. **Protecting honor** and mahram relationships
3. **Strengthening family** and social bonds
4. **Guaranteeing the rights** of children
5. **Prohibiting marriage** between close relatives due to its harms

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf

### Zayd ibn Haritha and the Abolition of Adoption

**Zayd ibn Haritha** (may Allah be pleased with him) was captured as a young boy and sold. Hakim ibn Hizam purchased him for his aunt Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her), who gifted him to the Prophet ﷺ.

His father Haritha and his uncle came searching for him. When they found him with the Prophet ﷺ, they said: "O Muhammad, you are the son of the leader of your people. Return our son to us and be generous in his ransom."

The Prophet ﷺ said with amazing generosity: **"Give him the choice. If he chooses you, he is yours without ransom."**

When Zayd was given the choice, he said words that shook those present: **"I would not choose anyone over you. You are to me in the place of father and uncle!"**

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"O people of Quraysh, bear witness that this is my son, he inherits from me and I inherit from him."**

So he became known as: **Zayd ibn Muhammad**.

Then the Quran came down abolishing this adoption:

> **﴾Call them by their fathers' names; that is more just in the sight of Allah﴿**

So he returned to being called: **Zayd ibn Haritha**.

**The lesson:** Islam preserved lineages from mixing, and distinguished between forbidden adoption (attributing the child to other than his father) and recommended sponsorship (caring for and raising the orphan).

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### Case One: IVF Between Spouses

**Question:** A couple cannot conceive naturally, and the doctor advised them of in vitro fertilization (taking sperm from the husband and egg from the wife, then implanting the embryo in the wife's womb). Is this permissible?

**Answer:** **Yes, it is permissible** if the conditions are met:
1. The sperm must be from the husband
2. The egg must be from the wife
3. The embryo must be implanted in the wife's own womb
4. This must be done while the marriage is in effect
5. Precautions against mixing must be taken

The child in this case is attributed to his parents legally.

---

### Case Two: Surrogate Mother (Womb Rental)

**Question:** A couple took the wife's egg and husband's sperm, but the wife cannot carry for medical reasons, so they implanted the embryo in another woman's womb for payment. What is the ruling?

**Answer:** **It is forbidden**, not permissible. This is called "womb rental" and is among the prohibitions for several reasons:
1. Introducing a man's genetic material into a woman who is a stranger to him
2. Confusion of lineage: Who is his mother? The egg owner or the carrier?
3. Degrading women's dignity by making her womb a commodity

The Islamic Fiqh Council has issued a fatwa prohibiting it.

---

### Case Three: Orphan Sponsorship and Family Name

**Question:** A family sponsored an orphan since he was young. Now he is 10 years old and they want to register him with their name to make things easier for him at school and with official papers. What is the ruling?

**Answer:** **It is not permissible** to attribute him to them as their son. This is forbidden adoption. However, they can:
1. Add their name as "sponsored by" (in some countries: Muhammad ibn Abdullah under the sponsorship of Al-Fulan family)
2. Or he keeps his father's name if known, or a name indicating his lineage

Allah says: **﴾Call them by their fathers' names﴿**

As for care, kindness, and inheritance through bequest, all of these are permissible.

---

### Case Four: Milk Banks

**Question:** In Western hospitals, there are "milk banks" that collect mothers' milk and give it to premature babies. A Muslim woman gave birth in such a hospital and they gave her baby from this bank. What is the ruling?

**Answer:** This is **problematic** from a legal perspective because:
1. The child may nurse from several women without knowing them
2. This creates unknown breastfeeding prohibitions
3. He may marry a foster sister without knowing

**The safer approach:** A Muslim woman should avoid this if possible, and breastfeed her child herself or from a known wet nurse.

---

### Case Five: DNA Testing and Lineage

**Question:** A man doubted that his son was from him, and wanted to do a DNA test. Is this permissible? Can it be relied upon to establish or deny lineage?

**Answer:**
1. **The principle:** Lineage is established through the marriage bed, and a man may not accuse his wife without evidence
2. **DNA testing:** Strong evidence but not 100% conclusive
3. **Denying lineage:** Cannot be done except through legal li'an (mutual cursing)
4. **Establishing lineage:** DNA can be used as supporting evidence, but it does not alone establish lineage for one of unknown lineage according to some scholars

Detail: If lineage is established through the marriage bed, it is not denied except through li'an. If lineage is disputed, DNA can be used as circumstantial evidence.

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

> Reflect on how Islam preserved the orphan's rights in the best way: it permitted sponsoring, raising, and being kind to him, but it forbade attributing him to other than his father so he does not lose his original identity and lineages do not mix. Islam combines mercy (sponsorship) with justice (preserving lineage). Is this not more complete than the Western adoption system that completely erases the child's original identity?
