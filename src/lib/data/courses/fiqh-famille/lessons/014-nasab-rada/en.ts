## 📖 Introduction

### 📜 Scene: The Surprise Discovery

> **At the wedding preparations...**
>
> The mother suddenly remembered: *"Wait... didn't Umm Ahmad breastfeed you when you were a baby?"*
>
> The bride froze. *"So... is Ahmad..."*
>
> The mother asked the scholar urgently.
>
> The scholar asked: *"How many times did she breastfeed her?"*
>
> The mother said: *"I'm not sure... maybe several times..."*
>
> The scholar said:
>
> **"We need to establish this. If it was five or more satisfying feeds, they are milk siblings and cannot marry!"**

> 🎯 **Breastfeeding creates real family bonds with real consequences!**

### 📜 Scene: Protecting Lineage

> **The Prophet ﷺ was very strict about lineage...**
>
> He said:
>
> **"Whoever claims to belong to other than his father, or attributes himself to other than his masters (for freed slaves), upon him is the continuous curse of Allah, the angels, and all people."**
>
> — **[Muslim]**

> ⚠️ **Lineage in Islam is sacred — it cannot be forged or denied!**

> **Imam Ibn al-Qayyim** — may Allah have mercy on him — said:
>
> **"Allah made the woman who nourishes a child with her milk like the woman who nourished him in her womb — both create a bond that affects marriage law. This shows Islam's appreciation for nurturing."**
