# Lineage and Breastfeeding (An-Nasab wa Ar-Rada')

## Part One: Lineage (An-Nasab)

### Definition of Lineage

**Linguistic meaning**: Nasab means kinship and attachment.

**Legal definition**: It is the **relationship of the child to his father that results in legal rights and obligations**.

Allah says: {It is He who created from water a human being and made for him blood-relations and marriage-relations} [Al-Furqan: 54]

### Importance of Lineage in Islam

Lineage is one of the greatest objectives of Sharia because it:

1. **Preserves bloodlines** from mixing
2. **Guarantees the rights** of children
3. **Forms the basis** for inheritance and guardianship
4. **Maintains family ties** and strengthens bonds

The Prophet ﷺ said: «**The child belongs to the marriage bed, and the fornicator gets the stone**» [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]

---

### Methods of Establishing Lineage

#### 1. Valid Marriage Bed

Valid marriage is the primary way to establish lineage.

**Conditions for establishing lineage through marriage:**
- The **minimum pregnancy duration** (six months) must have passed since the contract
- The husband must be **capable of procreation**
- The duration must not exceed the **maximum pregnancy period** (four years according to some jurists)

#### 2. Acknowledgment of Paternity

When a man acknowledges that someone is his child.

**Conditions for valid acknowledgment:**
- The acknowledged person must be of **unknown lineage**
- It must be **possible** for them to be his child
- The acknowledged person must **confirm** if they are an adult

#### 3. Testimonial Evidence

Testimony of two upright witnesses establishing lineage.

### Prohibition of Adoption in Islam

Forbidden adoption: Attributing a child to someone other than his biological father.

Allah says: {Call them by their fathers' names; that is more just in the sight of Allah} [Al-Ahzab: 5]

And He says: {Nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons} [Al-Ahzab: 4]

**What is permissible:**
- **Kafala**: Caring for and raising an orphan without changing his lineage
- **Sponsorship**: Providing for a child of unknown lineage

The Prophet ﷺ said: «**I and the guardian of the orphan will be in Paradise like this**» showing his index and middle fingers [Al-Bukhari]

---

### Prohibition of Claiming Other Than One's Father

The Prophet ﷺ said: «**Whoever claims to be the son of someone other than his father while knowing he is not his father, Paradise is forbidden for him**» [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]

And he said: «**No man claims to be the son of someone other than his father while knowing it, except that he has committed disbelief**» [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]

## Part Two: Breastfeeding (Ar-Rada')

### Definition of Prohibitive Breastfeeding

**Linguistic meaning**: Rida'a means sucking milk from the breast.

**Legal definition**: It is the **reaching of a woman's milk to a child's stomach during the breastfeeding period**.

Allah says: {And your mothers who nursed you and your sisters through nursing} [An-Nisa: 23]

### Legal Ruling on Breastfeeding

Breastfeeding **creates a relationship of mahram** (unmarriageable kin) like blood relations.

The Prophet ﷺ said: «**What is forbidden through lineage is forbidden through breastfeeding**» [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]

---

### Conditions for Prohibitive Breastfeeding

#### 1. Breastfeeding must occur within the first two years

Allah says: {Mothers shall breastfeed their children for two complete years} [Al-Baqarah: 233]

The Prophet ﷺ said: «**There is no breastfeeding except within the first two years**» [Ad-Daraqutni]

#### 2. Five or more sucklings

Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) said: «**It was revealed in the Quran: ten known sucklings make forbidden, then it was abrogated by five known sucklings**» [Muslim]

#### 3. The milk must reach the stomach

Whether through direct breastfeeding, pouring into the mouth, or through the nose.

### Women Forbidden Through Breastfeeding

What is forbidden through breastfeeding mirrors what is forbidden through lineage:

| Through Lineage | Through Breastfeeding |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Mother | Foster mother |
| Daughter | Foster daughter |
| Sister | Foster sister |
| Paternal aunt | Foster paternal aunt |
| Maternal aunt | Foster maternal aunt |
| Brother's daughter | Foster brother's daughter |
| Sister's daughter | Foster sister's daughter |

### Those Not Forbidden Through Breastfeeding

Breastfeeding does not forbid:
- **The wet nurse's mother**: Not a foster grandmother to the nursling
- **The wet nurse's sister**: Not a foster maternal aunt to the nursling
- **The nursling's biological siblings**: No prohibition between them and the wet nurse's children

> **Rule**: Breastfeeding establishes prohibition for the nursling only, not for his biological siblings.

---

### The Father's Milk (Laban Al-Fahl)

**Meaning**: The wet nurse's husband (the owner of the milk) becomes the foster father of the nursling.

**Effect**: The nursling is also forbidden from marrying this man's daughters from other wives.

**Evidence**: Aisha's narration about the story of Aflah, brother of Abu Al-Qu'ays: The Prophet ﷺ said: «**Let him in, for he is your uncle**» [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]

---

### Establishing Breastfeeding

Breastfeeding is established through:

1. **The testimony of one woman** according to some jurists
2. **The testimony of two women** according to others
3. **The wet nurse's admission** of breastfeeding

When the Prophet ﷺ was asked about a woman's testimony regarding breastfeeding, he said: «**Yes**» [Al-Bukhari]

---

### Miscellaneous Rulings

#### Child's right to breastfeeding
Breastfeeding is the child's right from his mother during the first two years.

#### Wages for breastfeeding
The wet nurse is entitled to wages if she breastfeeds a child other than her own.

Allah says: {If they breastfeed for you, give them their wages} [At-Talaq: 6]

#### Milk banks
Contemporary scholars differ on this issue, and it is more cautious to avoid them to preserve the clarity of lineages.

2. **Protecting honor** and mahram relationships
