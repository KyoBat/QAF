Allah says: **"And among His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them, and He placed between you affection and mercy"** [Ar-Rum: 21]

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf

### The Prophet ﷺ: The Role Model in Treating Wives

#### With Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her) - Loyalty After Death

The Prophet ﷺ would frequently mention Khadijah after her death, to the point that Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) became jealous. Aisha said: "I never felt jealous of any woman as much as I did of Khadijah, though I never saw her. But the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would mention her often, and sometimes he would slaughter a sheep, cut it into pieces, and send them to Khadijah's friends."

One day I said to him: "It is as if there were no other woman in the world except Khadijah!" He ﷺ said: **"She was this and that, and I had children from her"** [Agreed upon].

**🌟 Lesson**: Loyalty to a wife does not end with her death, and honoring her friends is part of good companionship.

#### With Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) - Gentleness and Playfulness

Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) said: "The Messenger of Allah ﷺ raced with me and I won. We stayed until I gained weight, then he raced with me and he won. He said: **'This one is for that one'"** [Reported by Abu Dawud].

He ﷺ would call her "O Aish" affectionately, and would drink from the same spot on the vessel from which she drank.

---

#### With Safiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her) - Mending Hearts

Safiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her) cried because some of the Prophet's ﷺ wives taunted her about her Jewish origin. The Prophet ﷺ came to her while she was crying and said: **"What makes you cry?"** She said: "Hafsah and Aisha said to me: 'We are better than you; we are the Prophet's ﷺ cousins and wives.'"

He ﷺ said to her: **"Why did you not say: 'How can you be better than me when my father is Aaron, my uncle is Moses, and my husband is Muhammad?'"** [Reported by Tirmidhi]

**🌟 Lesson**: A righteous husband mends his wife's heart, elevates her status, and does not leave her to those who harm her.

### From the Companions' Stances

**Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him)**: A man came to him complaining about his wife. When he stood at Umar's door to ask permission, he heard Umar's wife raising her voice at him while Umar remained silent. The man turned to leave. Umar called him and asked his need. The man said: "I came to complain about my wife, and I found the Commander of the Faithful in the same situation!" Umar said: **"I bear with her for the rights she has over me: she cooks my food, bakes my bread, washes my clothes, nurses my children—and none of that is obligatory upon her—and my heart finds contentment with her away from the forbidden. So I bear with her for that."**

The man said: O Commander of the Faithful, my wife is the same! Umar said: **"Then bear with her, my brother, for it is but a short time."**

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### Case One: Disagreement Over the Wife Working

**Question**: A wife wants to work outside the home to help with family expenses, but the husband refuses. Who is right?

**Answer**: The principle is that a woman does not go out except with her husband's permission, but:
- If there is genuine financial need and the husband cannot provide, she has the right to work
- If the work is modest and does not harm the husband's or children's rights, mutual understanding is preferable
- The husband's absolute control in these matters contradicts the spirit of Shariah which calls for kind treatment
- Dialogue and understanding are better than conflict, and they can agree on guidelines that satisfy both

---

### Case Two: Wife Living with In-Laws

**Question**: A wife lives with her in-laws and suffers from problems with her mother-in-law. She requests separate housing, but the husband refuses for financial reasons. What is the ruling?

**Answer**: Separate housing is the wife's right if she requests it, as Allah says: "Lodge them where you dwell according to your means." However:
- If financial circumstances do not allow, she should be patient while seeking improvement
- If there is real harm (insults, interference in her affairs, constant disputes), the husband must provide separate housing even if modest
- The husband may not require his wife to serve his family, as this is not obligatory upon her

---

### Case Three: Refusing Marital Relations

**Question**: A wife refuses marital relations because she is exhausted from work and caring for the children, and the husband cites the hadith. What is the ruling?

**Answer**: Yes, responding to the husband is his right, but:
- The hadith refers to refusal without a legitimate excuse
- Severe fatigue and illness are considered valid excuses
- Kind treatment requires considering the wife's circumstances
- The husband should lighten his wife's burden and help her so she is psychologically and physically ready
- Understanding and affection are the foundation of the relationship, not coercion and pressure

---

### Case Four: Maintenance for a Working Wife

**Question**: A wife works and her salary is higher than her husband's. Does she lose her right to maintenance? Can he take from her salary?

**Answer**: 
- Maintenance is obligatory upon the husband regardless of the wife's income, and her salary belongs to her; she is not required to share it
- The husband has no right to take from her money except with her consent
- If she voluntarily helps, it is charity and a favor from her
- Sharing expenses by mutual consent is permissible and praiseworthy if done willingly

---

### Case Five: Preventing the Wife from Visiting Her Family

**Question**: A husband prevents his wife from visiting her family except once a month, while she wants to visit weekly. What is the ruling?

**Answer**: Maintaining family ties is obligatory, and completely preventing the wife from her family is forbidden. However:
- The husband has the right to organize outings reasonably
- Once a month may be unjust if the family is nearby and needs her
- The reference is the prevailing custom in the country
- Moderation is required: neither excessive going out that harms the home, nor neglecting ties that severs kinship

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

**Question for Contemplation**: The Prophet ﷺ said: "The best of you is the one who is best to his family," yet many men treat strangers well while mistreating their wives and families.

🤔 **Reflect on yourself**: Are you with your family as you are with people? Do you show your wife the same kindness and respect you show your guests and friends? The Prophet ﷺ was the best of people in character with his family—so how is your character at home?

## Conclusion

Married life in Islam is based on balance and justice. Each spouse has rights and duties, and observing these rights achieves happiness and stability for the Muslim family.

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"The most complete believers in faith are those with the best character, and the best of you are those who are best to their wives"** [Reported by Tirmidhi]
