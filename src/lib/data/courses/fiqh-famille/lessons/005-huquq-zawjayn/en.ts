## 💭 Reflection

> **The Prophet ﷺ said in his Farewell Sermon:**
>
> **"Fear Allah regarding women, for you have taken them as a trust from Allah, and intimacy with them has been made lawful through Allah's word... They have rights over you: to be provided for and clothed in kindness."**
>
> — **[Muslim]**

> 🎯 **Rights without kindness become oppression. Duties without love become burdens. Balance is the key.**
