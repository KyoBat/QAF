## 📖 Setting the Scene

### An Extraordinary Era

Imagine an era where:
- A **fabric merchant** in Kufa becomes the greatest jurist of his time
- An **orphan child** in Medina memorizes thousands of hadiths and never leaves his city
- A **Qurayshi teenager** crosses the desert to study and codifies a new science
- A **young man** endures torture rather than betray his faith

This era existed. It was the **2nd and 3rd century of the Hijra** (8th-9th century CE).

In just **161 years** (80-241 AH), four men laid the foundations of Islamic Fiqh as we know it today.

## 🌍 The Historical Context

### 📅 The Timeline

| Year AH | Major Event |
|---------|-------------|
| **41 AH** | Beginning of Umayyad Caliphate (Mu'āwiya) |
| **80 AH** | 🟢 Birth of Abū Ḥanīfa in Kufa |
| **93 AH** | 🟡 Birth of Mālik in Medina |
| **95 AH** | Death of the last Companion (Anas ibn Mālik) |
| **132 AH** | Fall of Umayyads, beginning of Abbasids |
| **150 AH** | 🟢 Death of Abū Ḥanīfa / 🔵 Birth of Shāfi'ī |
| **164 AH** | 🟣 Birth of Aḥmad in Baghdad |
| **179 AH** | 🟡 Death of Mālik in Medina |
| **204 AH** | 🔵 Death of Shāfi'ī in Cairo |
| **241 AH** | 🟣 Death of Aḥmad in Baghdad |

### 🏛️ Two Empires, Two Eras

| Aspect | Umayyads (41-132 AH) | Abbasids (132-656 AH) |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Capital** | Damascus | Baghdad |
| **Focus** | Military expansion | Knowledge and sciences |
| **Language** | Arabization of state | Massive translations |
| **Imams concerned** | �� Abū Ḥanīfa, 🟡 Mālik | 🔵 Shāfi'ī, 🟣 Aḥmad |

---

## 🔥 Why This Era?

### 1️⃣ Proximity to the Prophet ﷺ

| Imam | Distance from the Prophet ﷺ |
|------|----------------------------|
| 🟢 **Abū Ḥanīfa** | Met some **Companions** (Anas ibn Mālik) |
| 🟡 **Mālik** | Student of the **Tābi'ūn** (Nāfi', Ibn Shihāb) |
| 🔵 **Shāfi'ī** | Student of **Mālik** (2 generations) |
| 🟣 **Aḥmad** | Student of **Shāfi'ī** (3 generations) |

> 💡 In 95 AH, the last Companion died. Abū Ḥanīfa was **15 years old**. He saw the blessed generation!

### 2️⃣ The Expansion of Islam

The Empire stretched from Spain to China. Each region brought its questions:

| Region | New Issues |
|--------|------------|
| **Iraq** | Trade, complex contracts, urbanization |
| **Medina** | Preserving the Sunna, prophetic practices |
| **Egypt** | Cultural mixing, Nile-related issues |
| **Persia** | Mass conversions, local customs |

### 3️⃣ The End of Oral Transmission

> ⚠️ **Urgent need**: The Companions are dying. Knowledge must be **codified** before it is lost.

In this context:
- 🟡 **Mālik** compiled the **Muwaṭṭa'** (first book of Fiqh/Hadith)
- 🔵 **Shāfi'ī** wrote **Ar-Risāla** (first codification of Uṣūl)
- 🟣 **Aḥmad** compiled the **Musnad** (30,000 hadiths)

## 🕌 The 4 Imams in Their Era

### 🟢 Abū Ḥanīfa (80-150 AH) — The Iraqi

**The context:** Kufa is a bustling intellectual center. Hypothetical questions abound. Persian converts bring their issues.

> **"He would branch out issues and develop them."**
> — Description of his method

**His response:** Develop **Ra'y** (reasoning) and **Qiyās** (analogy) to answer new situations.

---

### 🟡 Mālik ibn Anas (93-179 AH) — The Medinan

**The context:** Medina is the city of the Prophet ﷺ. The practices of its people go back to the Companions. But innovations threaten.

> **"I never left Medina except for Hajj."**
> — Imam Mālik

**His response:** Preserve the **'Amal Ahl al-Madīna** (practice of the Medinans) as a source of Fiqh.

---

### 🔵 Ash-Shāfi'ī (150-204 AH) — The Traveler

**The context:** The Empire is vast. The schools of Kufa and Medina differ. A **method** is needed to arbitrate.

> **"If the hadith is authentic, it is my madhhab."**
> — Imam Shāfi'ī

**His response:** Codify **Uṣūl al-Fiqh** (foundations of jurisprudence) in *Ar-Risāla*.

---

### 🟣 Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal (164-241 AH) — The Guardian

**The context:** The Mu'tazila dominate. The caliph demands that the Quran is "created." Scholars yield under torture.

> **"I am not a man of Kalām. I see no [benefit in] debating on this."**
> — Imam Aḥmad

**His response:** Hold firmly to the **Naṣṣ** (text) and refuse all innovation, even under torture.

## 💡 Why 4 Schools and Not More?

### Dozens of Scholars, 4 Survivors

In that era, there were **many** other schools:
- The school of **Al-Awzā'ī** (Syria)
- The school of **Sufyān ath-Thawrī** (Kufa)
- The school of **Layth ibn Sa'd** (Egypt)
- The school of **Dāwūd aẓ-Ẓāhirī** (literalist)

**Why did only 4 survive?**

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Devoted students** | Each imam had students who codified and transmitted |
| **Preserved works** | The books survived and were copied |
| **Political support** | At certain times, caliphs favored these schools |
| **Geography** | Each school established itself in a region |

---

## 🌍 Geographic Distribution

| Region | Dominant School | Historical Reason |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 🇹🇷 Turkey, 🇵🇰 Pakistan, 🇮🇳 India | 🟢 **Hanafi** | Ottoman Empire, Delhi Sultanate |
| ��🇦 Maghreb, 🇲🇱 West Africa | 🟡 **Maliki** | Merchants and scholars from Kairouan |
| 🇪🇬 Egypt, 🇮🇩 Indonesia, 🇲🇾 Malaysia | 🔵 **Shafi'i** | Shāfi'ī died in Egypt, Yemeni merchants |
| 🇸🇦 Saudi Arabia | 🟣 **Hanbali** | Reform movement (18th century) |

## 🔗 The Chain That Unites Them

| Level | Names |
|-------|-------|
| **The Prophet ﷺ** | Source of knowledge |
| **Companions** | Ibn Mas'ūd, Ibn 'Umar, 'Ā'isha... |
| **Tābi'ūn** | Nāfi', Ibrahim an-Nakha'ī, Sa'īd... |
| **The Imams** | 🟢 Abū Ḥanīfa ← 🟡 Mālik ← 🔵 Shāfi'ī ← 🟣 Aḥmad |

> 💡 They are **all connected** through chains of transmission. This is no coincidence!

---

## ❓ Questions for Reflection

1. **Why** were the great schools born in Iraq and Medina, not in Mecca or Damascus?

2. **How** did the political context (Umayyads vs Abbasids) influence the science of Fiqh?

3. **Why** did some schools disappear (Awzā'ī, Layth) while others survived?
