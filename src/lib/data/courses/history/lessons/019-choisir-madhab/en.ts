## 🎬 Introduction

Must you follow a particular madhab? And how do you choose? This lesson answers the most important practical questions about the schools of law.

---

## ❓ Part 1: Why Follow a Madhab?

### 1. The Need for Methodology

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Can I understand the Quran and Sunna alone?** | The Quran and Sunna require specialized understanding |
| **Why not derive rulings myself?** | Derivation requires years of study |
| **Isn't the hadith enough?** | A hadith may be abrogated, restricted, or specified |

### 2. Avoiding Chaos

<div class="quote-box">

**Without a madhab:**
- Everyone issues their own fatawas
- Systematic choice of the easiest (cherry-picking)
- Contradictions in fatawas
- Loss of the community's legal identity

</div>

### 3. Benefiting from Scholars' Knowledge

- Madhabs are **the fruit of centuries** of study
- They contain **solutions to questions** you haven't thought of
- They provide a **consistent methodology** for daily life

## 🎯 Part 2: Criteria for Choice

### 1. Geography: Where Do You Live?

| Region | Dominant Madhab |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Turkey, Indian subcontinent, Central Asia** | Hanafi |
| **Morocco, North Africa, West Africa** | Maliki |
| **Indonesia, Malaysia, Egypt, Yemen** | Shafi'i |
| **Saudi Arabia, Gulf** | Hanbali |

### 2. Family and Community

<div class="quote-box">

**Important questions:**
- What is your parents' madhab?
- What is your local mosque's madhab?
- What is your community's madhab?

**Advice:** The simplest is usually to start with your family and community's madhab.

</div>

### 3. Availability of Resources

| Resources | Importance |
|-----------|------------|
| **Books of the madhab** | Do you find them in your language? |
| **Specialized scholars** | Is there someone to ask? |
| **Courses and programs** | Are they available in your language? |

### 4. Personal Preference (Methodology)

| Madhab | Distinctive Characteristic |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **Hanafi** | Facilitation, ijtihad, flexibility |
| **Maliki** | Medina tradition, practice of its people |
| **Shafi'i** | Clear methodology, moderation |
| **Hanbali** | Adherence to text, precaution |

## 🔄 Part 3: Can You Change Madhabs?

### Answer: Yes, but with conditions

| Condition | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Intention** | Don't change just to follow the easiest |
| **Knowledge** | Learn the new madhab well |
| **Commitment** | Don't jump from one madhab to another randomly |
| **Consultation** | Ask a scholar before changing |

---

## 🤝 Part 4: Talfiq (Combining Madhabs)

### What is Talfiq?

> Taking an opinion from one madhab on an issue, and an opinion from another madhab on another issue.

### Its Types

| Type | Ruling |
|------|--------|
| **Acceptable talfiq** | On different issues (my prayer is Shafi'i, my fasting is Hanafi) |
| **Rejected talfiq** | On the same issue in a way that contradicts all madhabs |

### Rejected Example

<div class="scene-box">

**❌ Example of rejected talfiq:**

A person makes ablution:
- Wipes a small part of their head (like Shafi'is)
- And touches their wife (doesn't break according to Hanafis)

**Result:** Their ablution is invalid according to both madhabs!
- Shafi'is: Touching a woman breaks ablution
- Hanafis: You must wipe a quarter of the head

</div>

## ⚠️ Part 5: Important Warnings

### 1. No to Madhab Fanaticism

<div class="quote-box">

**They all said:**

**Abu Hanifa:** "If the hadith is authentic, that is my madhab"

**Malik:** "Everyone's words can be accepted or rejected, except the occupant of this grave ﷺ"

**Al-Shafi'i:** "If you see my opinion contradict the hadith, throw my opinion against the wall"

**Ahmad:** "Don't imitate me, nor Malik, nor al-Shafi'i, and take from where they took"

</div>

### 2. No to Cherry-Picking

- Don't choose the easiest from each madhab
- This corrupts religion
- Follow one madhab as a base

### 3. No to Rejecting All Madhabs

- Calling to abandon madhabs = chaos
- "I follow the Quran and Sunna directly" ← But who explains them to you?
