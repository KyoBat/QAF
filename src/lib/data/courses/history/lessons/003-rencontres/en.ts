## 🏛️ The Meeting of Two Suns: Abū Ḥanīfa and Mālik

### The Context

🟢 **Abū Ḥanīfa** (80-150 AH) was based in Kufa, capital of the *ra'y* (legal reasoning) methodology.

🟡 **Mālik** (93-179 AH) was the guardian of Medina, bastion of the pure tradition of the Companions.

Two different approaches, two different cities, but deep mutual respect.

### The Meeting

During a pilgrimage, Abū Ḥanīfa met Mālik in Medina. Sources report that they debated **several fiqh questions**, including:

**1. Credit Sales (البيع بالتقسيط)**

> 🟢 Abū Ḥanīfa permitted certain forms of credit sales with price markup.
> 
> 🟡 Mālik was more restrictive, fearing disguised *ribā* (usury).

After discussion, each **maintained their position**, but with a deeper understanding of the other.

**2. Single Witness Testimony (شهادة الفرد)**

The two imams exchanged their evidences, citing different hadiths. This meeting showed that divergences were not arbitrary, but based on **different evidence**.

### The Famous Anecdote

It is reported that after their debate, Mālik said:

> "Abū Ḥanīfa, if he spoke to this pillar, he would convince it!"

This was **praise** for his reasoning abilities, not criticism. Mālik recognized Abū Ḥanīfa's dialectical genius.

### The Lesson

These two giants met, debated, then **parted with mutual respect**. Neither accused the other of misguidance. This is the beauty of *ikhtilāf* (divergence) in fiqh.

## 📚 The Long Companionship: Mālik and Al-Shāfi'ī

### The First Contact

In **163 AH / 780 CE**, a 20-year-old young man arrived in Medina with a letter from the governor of Mecca. This young man had already memorized the Quran and the entire *Muwaṭṭa'*.

He was 🔵 **al-Shāfi'ī**.

🟡 **Mālik**, then 70 years old, looked at this young Qurayshite and said:

> "O young man, I see that Allah has placed a light in your heart. Do not extinguish it with sin."

### The Years of Study (163-179 AH)

Al-Shāfi'ī stayed with Mālik for about **9 years**, until the master's death. During these years:

- He studied the *Muwaṭṭa'* in depth with its author
- He absorbed the Medinan methodology
- He observed how Mālik issued his fatwas
- He witnessed Mālik's respect for the consensus of Medina

### Moments of Divergence

Even as his student, al-Shāfi'ī did not blindly accept. One day, Mālik gave a fatwa. Al-Shāfi'ī asked:

> "What is the evidence, O Shaykh?"

Mālik, surprised but pleased, gave his evidence. It was this critical spirit, combined with respect, that made al-Shāfi'ī a great scholar.

### The Death of Mālik

When Mālik died in **179 AH**, al-Shāfi'ī wept abundantly. Years later, whenever he mentioned Mālik, he would say:

> "When scholars are mentioned, Mālik is the star."

Yet this did not prevent him from **developing his own school**, sometimes in disagreement with his revered teacher.

## ⚔️ The Intellectual Debate: Al-Shāfi'ī and Muḥammad al-Shaybānī

### The Context

🔵 **Al-Shāfi'ī** arrived in Baghdad around **184 AH / 800 CE**. There, he met **Muḥammad ibn al-Ḥasan al-Shaybānī**, the brilliant student of Abū Ḥanīfa.

It was the meeting of two worlds:
- The school of Medina (via al-Shāfi'ī)
- The school of Kufa (via al-Shaybānī)

### The Debate Sessions

For **two years**, al-Shāfi'ī and al-Shaybānī had legendary debates. Students flocked to listen.

**Example debate: Testimony (الشهادة)**

> 🔵 **Al-Shāfi'ī**: "The hadith of the Prophet ﷺ requires two Muslim witnesses."
> 
> 🟢 **Al-Shaybānī** (for the Hanafi school): "But we have cases where one witness with an oath suffices."
> 
> 🔵 **Al-Shāfi'ī**: "Show me your hadith."
> 
> 🟢 **Al-Shaybānī**: "It's based on *qiyās* (analogy) and the practice of Iraq."

These debates refined al-Shāfi'ī's methodology, and he later wrote his monumental *Risāla* — the first book of *Uṣūl al-Fiqh*.

### Respect Despite Disagreement

Despite their debates, al-Shāfi'ī said of al-Shaybānī:

> "I carried from him a camel's load of knowledge."

And al-Shaybānī, in turn, recognized al-Shāfi'ī's brilliance in hadith.

## 💫 The Meeting of Hearts: Al-Shāfi'ī and Aḥmad

### The First Contact

In **195 AH / 810 CE**, 🔵 **al-Shāfi'ī** returned to Baghdad. 🟣 **Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal**, then about 31 years old, heard of this extraordinary scholar.

Aḥmad, already a great muḥaddith (hadith specialist), was impressed by al-Shāfi'ī's methodology.

### The Learning Sessions

Aḥmad attended al-Shāfi'ī's classes with devotion. One day, someone asked Aḥmad:

> "Why do you sit with this young Qurayshite?"

Aḥmad replied:

> "When I hear him say 'It was narrated to us...', I know he is upon the truth."

### What Aḥmad Learned

From al-Shāfi'ī, Aḥmad learned:

1. **Methodology**: How to use the Quran, Sunnah, and *qiyās* systematically
2. ***Nāsikh wa-l-mansūkh***: How to distinguish abrogating texts from abrogated ones
3. **Defense of hadith**: How to respond to *Ahl al-Ra'y* who minimized hadith

### What Al-Shāfi'ī Learned

From Aḥmad, al-Shāfi'ī gained:

1. **Access to hadiths**: Aḥmad knew thousands of hadiths al-Shāfi'ī didn't have
2. **Hadith criticism**: How to evaluate chain authenticity
3. **Humility**: Aḥmad was known for his extreme piety

### The Separation

When al-Shāfi'ī left Baghdad for Egypt (around 199 AH), he said:

> "I did not leave anyone in Baghdad more knowledgeable in fiqh, more pious, or more learned than Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal."

This was the **final farewell**. The two never saw each other again.

### The Death of Al-Shāfi'ī

When news of al-Shāfi'ī's death (204 AH) reached Baghdad, Aḥmad wept and said:

> "He was like the sun for the people, and like health for the body."

Aḥmad then refused to **create his own school** for a long time, saying he was not worthy of contradicting his teacher. It was his students who compiled his opinions into a school.

## 💡 Lessons from These Encounters

### 1. Disagreement is Not Hostility

These imams debated vigorously, but **they never hated each other**. Disagreement in fiqh is natural and enriching.

### 2. Learn from Everyone

Al-Shāfi'ī learned from Mālik (Medina) AND al-Shaybānī (Kufa). He didn't disdain one school for the other.

### 3. Recognize Superiority

Each imam recognized the superior qualities of others. No jealousy, no pride.

### 4. The Student Can Surpass the Teacher

Al-Shāfi'ī developed what Mālik taught him. Aḥmad refined what al-Shāfi'ī transmitted to him. This is **the natural progression of knowledge**.
