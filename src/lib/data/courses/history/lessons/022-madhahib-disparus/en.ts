<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Story of the disappearance:**

The madhab of al-Awza'i was **the official madhab of Sham and Andalusia** for centuries.

But:
1. The Shafi'i madhab entered Sham (4th century H)
2. The Maliki madhab entered Andalusia with Ziyad ibn Abd al-Rahman
3. Al-Awza'i didn't have students of the caliber of the Four

**Result:** The madhab gradually disappeared by the 5th century H.
