## 📖 Introduction

The four imams were not scholars locked away in their libraries. They lived in a tumultuous political world — caliphates, revolutions, palace intrigues. And each of them had to **confront power** in their own way.

This lesson tells of their trials, their courage, and the lessons they left us about the relationship between **the scholar and the sultan**.

## 🟢 Abū Ḥanīfa: Refusing Power

### The Political Context

Abū Ḥanīfa (80-150 AH) lived under two dynasties:
- The **Umayyads** (until 132 AH)
- The **Abbasids** (from 132 AH)

He witnessed the Abbasid revolution overthrow the Umayyads — a bloody upheaval.

### The Caliph's Offer

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 At the Caliph's Palace — Baghdad, circa 148 AH**

*The caliph al-Manṣūr summoned Abū Ḥanīfa to his imperial palace. The courtiers stepped aside respectfully to let the scholar pass.*

**👑 Al-Manṣūr:** "O Abū Ḥanīfa! I appoint you Qāḍī al-Quḍāt over the entire empire. You will be the Chief Justice of Baghdad — the highest judicial position."

*An immense honor. But Abū Ḥanīfa's face remained impassive.*

**🟢 Abū Ḥanīfa:** "I am not fit to be a judge."

**👑 Al-Manṣūr:** "How dare you refuse? You are the greatest jurist in the empire!"

**🟢 Abū Ḥanīfa:** "If I speak the truth, then I am not fit. And if I lie, a liar is not worthy of judging between people."

*The caliph's face darkened...*

</div>

### The Reason for Refusal

Abū Ḥanīfa knew that:
1. Power corrupts a scholar's independence
2. A judge appointed by the caliph would be under political pressure
3. He might have to render unjust verdicts

He preferred to remain a **cloth merchant** and teach freely.

### The Punishment

<div class="scene-box">

**⛓️ In the Dungeons of Baghdad — 150 AH**

*Al-Manṣūr did not accept the refusal. Abū Ḥanīfa was thrown into prison. Every day, the guards came to flog him to force him to accept.*

*Every day, he was flogged. Every day, he refused.*

**🗡️ The Guard:** "Accept the position, old man, and all this will stop!"

**🟢 Abū Ḥanīfa:** "If he wanted me to count the doors of the mosque for him, I wouldn't do it..."

**🗡️ The Guard:** "And why not?"

**🟢 Abū Ḥanīfa:** "How then could he want me to sign an innocent man's execution?"

*Abū Ḥanīfa's hair turned white under the torture. "Whoever wants to know what I endure," he said, "let them look at the snow on my head."*

</div>

### Death in Prison

Abū Ḥanīfa died in **150 AH**, probably in prison or shortly after his release. Some sources say he was poisoned.

He was **70 years old**. He died a free man, having refused to sell his conscience.

### The Lesson

> 🟢 **Abū Ḥanīfa teaches us**: Knowledge must not serve unjust power. Better prison than compromise.

## 🟡 Mālik: Dignity Under Torture

### The Political Context

Mālik (93-179 AH) lived primarily under the Abbasids, in Medina. Though far from Baghdad, he did not escape politics.

### The Forced Oath Affair

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Before the Governor — Medina, 147 AH**

*The governor of Medina, Ja'far ibn Sulaymān, summoned Mālik. He wanted to force people to pledge allegiance to the caliph.*

**👑 Ja'far:** "O Mālik, you must declare that this oath of allegiance is obligatory and irrevocable!"

**🟡 Mālik:** "I cannot."

**👑 Ja'far:** "And why not?"

**🟡 Mālik:** "Divorce pronounced under coercion is not valid — by analogy, a forced oath is also not valid."

*The governor's face reddened with anger.*

**👑 Ja'far:** "You dare defy the caliph's authority? Guards!"

</div>

### The Torture

<div class="scene-box">

**💔 The Imam's Torture**

*The governor ordered that Mālik's arm be dislocated. The torturers pulled so hard that his shoulder was torn from its socket.*

*Mālik did not cry out. He did not yield.*

*For the rest of his life, he could never raise that arm again. But his word remained straight.*

</div>

### The Aftermath

After this ordeal, the caliph **al-Manṣūr** (the same who had imprisoned Abū Ḥanīfa) sent apologies to Mālik and punished the governor.

Al-Manṣūr even proposed making the **Muwaṭṭa'** the official law code of the empire. Mālik **refused**:

> "Do not do this, for the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ dispersed to different regions, and each people has its own knowledge."

He refused to have his book forcibly imposed on other regions.

### The Lesson

> 🟡 **Mālik teaches us**: The scholar maintains his dignity even under torture. And he does not use power to impose his views.

## 🔵 Al-Shāfi'ī: The Political Accused

### The Political Context

Al-Shāfi'ī (150-204 AH) lived an eventful life, traveling between Mecca, Medina, Yemen, Baghdad, and Egypt.

### The Accusation of Rebellion

In **184 AH**, al-Shāfi'ī was **accused of being a Shia sympathizer** and supporting a rebellion in Yemen.

He was arrested and sent **in chains** to caliph **Hārūn al-Rashīd** in Baghdad to be tried — a journey of several weeks in chains.

The potential penalty: **death**.

### The Trial

<div class="scene-box">

**⚖️ Before the Caliph — Baghdad, 184 AH**

*Al-Shāfi'ī, still in chains, was brought before Hārūn al-Rashīd. The Hanafi judge Muḥammad ibn al-Ḥasan al-Shaybānī was present.*

**👑 Hārūn al-Rashīd:** "You are accused of supporting the rebels in Yemen. What do you have to say in your defense?"

*Al-Shāfi'ī pleaded his case with remarkable eloquence, citing evidence of his innocence and demonstrating his knowledge.*

*Al-Shaybānī listened attentively. Then he turned to the caliph:*

**🟢 Al-Shaybānī:** "O Commander of the Faithful, this is a man who learns and teaches — he is no rebel."

**👑 Hārūn al-Rashīd:** "Then let him be freed."

*The chains fell away. Al-Shāfi'ī was free — and he had just found his next teacher.*

</div>

### The Transformation

This trial transformed al-Shāfi'ī. Instead of returning to Yemen, he stayed in Baghdad to **study with al-Shaybānī** — the one who had saved him.

The political accusation became an opportunity for a major intellectual encounter.

### The Lesson

> 🔵 **Al-Shāfi'ī teaches us**: Trials can open unexpected doors. Today's adversary can become tomorrow's teacher.

## 🟣 Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal: The Lion of the Miḥna

### The Context: The Great Trial

The **Miḥna** (محنة, "the Trial/Inquisition") was the greatest theological crisis in Islamic history.

In **218 AH**, caliph **al-Ma'mūn** adopted the **Mu'tazilite** doctrine that the Quran was **created** (مخلوق), not eternal.

He imposed this doctrine on all scholars under penalty of death.

### Aḥmad's Position

For Aḥmad, the Quran was the **Word of Allah**, therefore **uncreated**. To say it was created was to diminish its sacredness.

This was a matter of **'aqīda** (creed), not fiqh. Aḥmad could not yield.

### The Scholars Yield

Under threat, most great scholars accepted the imposed doctrine — reluctantly, through **taqiyya** (permitted dissimulation in case of danger).

Even **Yaḥyā ibn Ma'īn**, one of the greatest muḥaddiths, yielded.

But **Aḥmad refused**.

### The Interrogation

<div class="scene-box">

**⚔️ The Inquisition — Baghdad, 218 AH**

*Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal was brought in chains before the Mu'tazilite inquisitors. The hall was filled with the caliph's theologians.*

**🗡️ The Inquisitor:** "Is the Quran created or uncreated?"

*A deathly silence. All eyes turned to Aḥmad.*

**🟣 Aḥmad:** "It is the Word of Allah. From Him it began, and to Him it returns."

**🗡️ The Inquisitor:** "That is not the answer we want! Say that the Quran is created!"

**🟣 Aḥmad:** "Give me something from the Book of Allah or the Sunnah of His Messenger. Only then will I say it."

*He refused to pronounce the word "created." And no torture could break him.*

</div>

### The Flogging

Caliph **al-Mu'taṣim** (al-Ma'mūn's successor) ordered that Aḥmad be flogged until he yielded or died.

For **two years** (from 220 to 222 AH), Aḥmad was imprisoned and regularly flogged.

A witness recounted:

> "He was given so many lashes that he fainted. When he regained consciousness, they started again."

Some say he received **more than 80 lashes** in a single session.

### The Resistance

<div class="scene-box">

**⛓️ In the Dungeons — Two Years of Torture**

*For two years, Aḥmad was flogged regularly. He was given so many lashes that he fainted. When he regained consciousness, they started again.*

*One day, a torturer approached:*

**🗡️ The Torturer:** "Just say the word, old man! Say that the Quran is created, and you'll be free!"

**🟣 Aḥmad:** "Give me something from the Book of Allah or the Sunnah of His Messenger. Then I will say it."

**🗡️ The Torturer:** "But we have nothing of the sort!"

**🟣 Aḥmad:** "Then I have nothing to say."

*The whips cracked again. But Aḥmad never yielded.*

</div>

### The Liberation

In **222 AH**, caliph al-Mu'taṣim, perhaps ashamed or fearing public opinion, freed Aḥmad.

The Miḥna continued under the next caliph, but Aḥmad was left alone.

### The Final Triumph

In **234 AH**, caliph **al-Mutawakkil** abolished the Miḥna and restored the traditional doctrine.

Aḥmad, who had **survived** three persecuting caliphs, saw his position vindicated.

At his death in **241 AH**, **hundreds of thousands** of people attended his funeral — a testimony to the people's love.

### The Lesson

> 🟣 **Aḥmad teaches us**: When truth is at stake, there is no compromise. Patience in the face of injustice ultimately triumphs.

## 📊 Comparison of Trials

| Imam | Trial | Duration | Torture | Outcome |
|------|-------|----------|---------|---------|

## 💬 Words in the Face of Oppression

### 🟢 Abū Ḥanīfa

> "I want Paradise and I do not want to help in oppression."

### 🟡 Mālik

When asked after his torture if he regretted, he said:

> "No, and if they did it again, I would do it again."

### 🔵 Al-Shāfi'ī

> "I never debated anyone without wishing that Allah would make the truth appear on their tongue."

### 🟣 Aḥmad

> "Tell the people of innovation: between us and them are the funerals."

(Meaning: truth is revealed by whom the people honor at their death)

## 🎓 Lessons for Our Time

### 1. The Scholar's Independence

The authentic scholar **does not sell himself** to power. His authority comes from his knowledge and integrity, not from official titles.

### 2. Courage in the Face of Injustice

When truth is threatened, silence is complicity. Our imams paid the price in blood to not remain silent.

### 3. Patience in Trial

None of them took up arms or called for violence. They endured with **ṣabr** (patience), knowing that truth ultimately triumphs.

### 4. Rejection of Forced Uniformity

Mālik refused to have his Muwaṭṭa' imposed on everyone. The diversity of schools is a **richness**, not a problem to be eliminated.

## 📝 Summary

All four imams confronted the political power of their time:

- 🟢 **Abū Ḥanīfa**: Refused the supreme position, died in prison
- 🟡 **Mālik**: Tortured for a fatwa, maintained his dignity
- 🔵 **Al-Shāfi'ī**: Accused of rebellion, acquitted by his future teacher
- 🟣 **Aḥmad**: Resisted alone against an imposed doctrine, triumphed after death

Their example reminds us that **true knowledge does not fear power**.
