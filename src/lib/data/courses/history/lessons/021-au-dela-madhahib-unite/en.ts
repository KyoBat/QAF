> **"The divergence of my community is a mercy"**

## 📖 Introduction

The four madhabs are not warring sects, but complementary interpretations of one Sharia. This lesson addresses the ethics of disagreement and the unity of the Ummah.

---

## 📜 Part 1: The Ethics of Disagreement

### 1. Disagreement is a Cosmic Law

<div class="quote-box">

**Allah says:**

﴾ And if your Lord had willed, He would have made mankind one community. But they will not cease to differ ﴿

*[Hud: 118]*

</div>

### 2. Blameworthy vs Praiseworthy Disagreement

| Type | Description | Ruling |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Diversity disagreement** | Difference in branches with agreement on foundations | Praiseworthy |
| **Contradiction disagreement** | Difference leading to division and hostility | Blameworthy |

### 3. Rules of the Ethics of Disagreement

| Rule | Application |
|------|-------------|
| **Correct without defaming** | Criticize the opinion, not the person |
| **Disagree without dividing** | Disagreement doesn't break affection |
| **Dialogue without fighting** | Dialogue by argument, not by sword |
| **Respect without mocking** | Each madhab has its evidence |

## 🕊️ Part 2: Relations Between the Imams

### 1. Abu Hanifa and Malik

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Meeting of the two scholars:**

When Abu Hanifa met Malik in Medina, Malik asked him about fiqh issues.

**Malik:** What do you say about such and such?

**Abu Hanifa:** (answers)

**Malik:** Where does that come from?

**Abu Hanifa:** From hadith such...

Then Malik told his students: **"I have never seen anyone more knowledgeable in fiqh than this man."**

</div>

### 2. Al-Shafi'i and Ahmad

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 The friendship of two imams:**

**Ahmad** said about al-Shafi'i:
"I have seen no one more knowledgeable of Allah's Book and His Messenger's Sunna than al-Shafi'i."

**Al-Shafi'i** said about Ahmad:
"I left Baghdad without leaving behind anyone more pious or more knowledgeable in fiqh than Ahmad ibn Hanbal."

</div>

### 3. Mutual Respect

| Imam | What he said about others |
|------|---------------------------|
| **Abu Hanifa** | "Malik is a master among the imams of Muslims" |
| **Malik** | "Al-Shafi'i is a miracle of knowledge" |
| **Al-Shafi'i** | "Abu Hanifa is the father of fiqh" |
| **Ahmad** | "No one has done me a favor like al-Shafi'i" |

## 🕌 Part 3: Praying Behind an Imam of Another Madhab

### The Question: Can I pray behind an imam of another madhab?

<div class="quote-box">

**The answer by consensus: Yes!**

- The Companions prayed behind each other despite their differences
- The four imams prayed behind imams of different madhabs
- Mosques hosted followers of all madhabs

</div>

### Historical Examples

| Situation | Significance |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Abu Hanifa prayed in the Prophet's Mosque ﷺ** | Behind Medinan (Maliki) imams |
| **Al-Shafi'i left the qunut in fajr** | Prayed behind a Hanafi in Baghdad |
| **Ahmad prayed behind al-Ma'mun** | Despite their disagreement on the creation of the Quran |

### The Practical Rule

| Case | Ruling |
|------|--------|
| **Disagreement in branches** | Pray without concern |
| **Disagreement in creed** | Pray for necessity or unity of ranks |
| **Excommunicating innovation** | Prohibition according to majority |

## 🌍 Part 4: Unity of the Ummah First

- Tawhid: There is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah
- The Noble Quran: Allah's preserved Book
- The five pillars of Islam
- The six pillars of faith
- 90% of fiqh rulings

**Fiqh disagreements: Only 10% and in the details!**

</div>

### 2. The Common Enemy

| Challenge | Danger |
|-----------|--------|
| **Atheism** | Denial of all religion |
| **Islamophobia** | Distortion of Islam's image |

## 💬 Part 5: Stories from Heritage

### 1. Tarawih Prayer at the Haram

<div class="scene-box">

**🕌 Mecca in the Golden Age:**

There were **four mihrabs** in the Sacred Mosque, one for each madhab.

After Isha prayer, an imam from each madhab would pray with their followers.

But during Hajj, they all prayed **together behind one imam**.

**Lesson:** Diversity in branches, unity in foundations.

</div>

### 2. Al-Azhar al-Sharif

<div class="quote-box">

**Model of unity:**

Since its founding in 970, Al-Azhar has taught **all four madhabs** side by side.

Each student chooses their madhab, but everyone studies together in one place.

</div>

### 3. The Caliphs and the Madhabs

| Caliph | Personal Madhab | Madhabs in His State |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Harun al-Rashid** | Hanafi | All madhabs |
| **Al-Ma'mun** | Mu'tazilite | All madhabs |
| **Saladin** | Shafi'i | All madhabs |
| **Ottomans** | Hanafi | All madhabs |

### 2. No to Excessive Laxity
