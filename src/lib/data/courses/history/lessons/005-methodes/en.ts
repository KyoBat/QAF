## 📖 Introduction

Why do we have **four schools** and not just one? Why does a Hanafi pray differently from a Maliki on certain points?

The answer lies in **methodology**: each imam had a different approach to extracting rulings (*istinbāṭ*) from the Quran and Sunnah.

This lesson reveals the **methodological secrets** of the four schools.

## 📚 The Common Sources

Before exploring differences, let's recall what **all imams agree upon**:

### Primary Sources

| Source | Status | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| 🕋 **The Quran** | Obligatory | Word of Allah, supreme source |
| 📜 **The Sunnah** | Obligatory | Sayings, actions, and approvals of the Prophet ﷺ |
| 👥 **Ijmā'** | Obligatory | Consensus of scholars on an issue |
| 🔄 **Qiyās** | Accepted by all | Analogical reasoning |

Differences in perspective are **never** about these sources, but about:
- How to **prioritize** them in case of apparent conflict
- How to **interpret** them
- Which **secondary sources** to use

## 🟢 The Hanafi Method: The School of Ra'y

### The Founder
**Abū Ḥanīfa al-Nu'mān** (80-150 AH) — Kufa, Iraq

### The Context
Kufa was far from Medina. Abū Ḥanīfa had less access to hadiths than Mālik, but he had to answer **new questions** in a cosmopolitan society.

### Key Principles

#### 1. Istiḥsān (الاستحسان) — Juristic Preference

When strict qiyās leads to an **unjust or impractical** result, the jurist may prefer another, more equitable rule.

> **Example**: By qiyās, manufacturing contracts (*istisnā'*) would be forbidden because one sells what doesn't yet exist. But by istiḥsān, it's permitted because people need it.

#### 2. 'Urf (العرف) — Local Custom

Local customs **not contrary to the Sharī'a** can become a source of law.

> **Example**: If in a region, the dowry is customarily paid in two installments, this is accepted even without explicit agreement.

#### 3. Priority of Practical Reason

Facing an isolated hadith (*āḥād*) that contradicts a **general Quranic principle** or **legal logic**, Hanafis may prioritize the principle.

### The Kufa Circle

Abū Ḥanīfa didn't work alone. He had a **council of 40 scholars** who debated each question:

> "We would sometimes discuss a question for a month before deciding."
> — **Abū Yūsuf**, student of Abū Ḥanīfa

## 🟡 The Maliki Method: The School of Athar

### The Founder
**Mālik ibn Anas** (93-179 AH) — Medina

### The Context
Medina was the city of the Prophet ﷺ. Descendants of the Companions still lived there. For Mālik, the **living practice of Medina** was proof in itself.

### Key Principles

#### 1. 'Amal Ahl al-Madīna (عمل أهل المدينة) — Practice of the Medinans

If the people of Medina practice something **generation after generation**, it's proof as strong as a hadith.

> **Example**: The Medinan adhān doesn't include "prayer is better than sleep" in the iqāma, despite some hadiths. Mālik follows Medinan practice.

**Reasoning**: Thousands of people saw the Prophet ﷺ pray. This collective transmission is more reliable than an isolated hadith.

#### 2. Al-Maṣlaḥa al-Mursala (المصلحة المرسلة) — Public Interest

When no text decides, the jurist may legislate according to the **general interest** of the community.

> **Example**: Mālik permitted the caliph to impose additional taxes in case of state need, even without explicit text.

#### 3. Sadd al-Dharā'i' (سد الذرائع) — Blocking the Means

Forbidding what is **permissible in itself** but probably leads to the forbidden.

> **Example**: Forbidding the sale of grapes to someone who will probably make wine from them.

#### 4. Mursal Hadith

Mālik accepts hadiths where a Tābi'ī reports directly from the Prophet ﷺ without mentioning the Companion intermediary, **if** Medinan practice confirms it.

## 🔵 The Shafi'i Method: The School of Synthesis

### The Founder
**Muḥammad ibn Idrīs al-Shāfi'ī** (150-204 AH) — Mecca → Medina → Baghdad → Egypt

### The Context
Al-Shāfi'ī studied with **Mālik** (Medina) and **al-Shaybānī** (Kufa). He **synthesized** both approaches and created the science of **Uṣūl al-Fiqh** (legal methodology).

### Key Principles

#### 1. The Risāla: The First Book of Uṣūl

Al-Shāfi'ī was the first to write a systematic treatise on **legal methodology**. His *Risāla* establishes clear rules.

#### 2. The Primacy of Text

> "No man can say 'this is ḥalāl and this is ḥarām' except based on knowledge. And that knowledge is the Quran and Sunnah."
> — **Al-Shāfi'ī**

Unlike Hanafis, al-Shāfi'ī gives **authentic āḥād hadith** nearly equal authority to the Quran.

#### 3. Rejection of Istiḥsān

Al-Shāfi'ī strongly criticized Hanafi istiḥsān:

> "Whoever practices istiḥsān has legislated [on his own]."

For him, qiyās must be applied rigorously, without subjective exceptions.

#### 4. Rejection of 'Amal Ahl al-Madīna

Al-Shāfi'ī didn't accept that Medinan practice could override an authentic hadith:

> "The Medinans are men, and we are men."

#### 5. Two Schools: Old and New

Al-Shāfi'ī revised many of his opinions after settling in Egypt:
- **Al-Madhhab al-Qadīm** (the old school) — Baghdad
- **Al-Madhhab al-Jadīd** (the new school) — Egypt

Shafi'is generally follow the new school.

## 🟣 The Hanbali Method: The School of Hadith

### The Founder
**Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal** (164-241 AH) — Baghdad

### The Context
Aḥmad was primarily a **muḥaddith** (hadith specialist). He compiled the *Musnad*, one of the largest hadith collections (over 27,000).

### Key Principles

#### 1. The Absolute Primacy of Hadith

> "Don't imitate me, don't imitate Mālik or al-Shāfi'ī. Take knowledge from where they took it."
> — **Imam Aḥmad**

For Aḥmad, even a **weak hadith** (*ḍa'īf*) is preferable to pure opinion (*ra'y*).

#### 2. Broadening Hadith Sources

Aḥmad accepted:
- **Mursal** hadiths (where the Companion isn't mentioned)
- **Ḍa'īf** (weak) hadiths — but only in the absence of any other text
- **Companion opinions**, treated almost like hadiths

#### 3. Distrust of Qiyās

Aḥmad used qiyās, but with **reluctance**:

> "I've never seen anyone practice qiyās without falling into error."

He preferred to abstain from answering rather than resort to reasoning.

#### 4. Multiple Opinions

Aḥmad often had **multiple opinions** on the same question, as he followed different hadiths without definitively deciding.

His students compiled these opinions, creating a school with **much internal flexibility**.

## 📊 Comparative Table

| Criterion | 🟢 Hanafi | 🟡 Maliki | 🔵 Shafi'i | 🟣 Hanbali |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|

## 🔍 Practical Examples

### Example 1: Does touching a woman invalidate wuḍū'?

**The verse**: *"or you have touched women"* (4:43)

| School | Ruling | Reasoning |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| 🟢 Hanafi | No | "Touch" here means intimacy (metaphor) |
| 🟡 Maliki | If with desire | Distinction based on intention |
| 🔵 Shafi'i | Yes (all contact) | Apparent meaning of verse |
| 🟣 Hanbali | If with desire | 'Ā'isha's hadith combined with verse |

### Example 2: Reciting al-Fātiḥa behind the imam

| School | Ruling | Reasoning |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| 🟢 Hanafi | No | Imam recites for all |
| 🟡 Maliki | Recommended (silent prayers) | Medinan practice |
| 🔵 Shafi'i | Obligatory | Hadith: "No prayer without Fātiḥa" |
| 🟣 Hanbali | Recommended | Combination of hadiths |

## 💡 The Wisdom of Differences

These differences in perspective aren't **flaws** but **riches**:

### 1. Flexibility for the Umma
Each context (time, place, situation) can find an adapted response.

### 2. Proof of Authenticity
If the imams had all copied each other, we might doubt. Their **independent** perspectives prove their intellectual honesty.

### 3. Depth of Fiqh
Debates between schools have **deepened** understanding of the texts.

## 📝 Summary

| School | Keyword | Strength | Risk |
|--------|---------|----------|------|
| 🟢 Hanafi | Ra'y | Adaptability | Distance from text |
| 🟡 Maliki | Living tradition | Continuity | Localism |
| 🔵 Shafi'i | Textual rigor | Clarity | Rigidity |
| 🟣 Hanbali | Hadith | Fidelity | Literalism |

Each school has its strengths and safeguards. **None is superior** to the others — they are complementary.
