## 💡 The Wisdom of Divergences

### 1. Flexibility for the Umma

Every context finds an adapted answer. What is difficult in one madhhab may be easy in another.

### 2. Proof of Honesty

If the imams had copied each other, we would doubt their sincerity. Their **independent** divergences prove their integrity.

### 3. Intellectual Richness

The debates **deepened** understanding of the texts and developed analytical tools.

---

## ⚠️ Rules of Disagreement

### What is Permitted

- ✅ Following **one** madhhab consistently
- ✅ Changing madhhab for a **valid reason**
- ✅ Studying the proofs and following the strongest

### What is Forbidden

- ❌ Blameworthy **talfīq**: combining opinions to avoid any obligation
- ❌ Criticizing other schools as **deviant**
- ❌ Imposing your madhhab as **the only true one**
