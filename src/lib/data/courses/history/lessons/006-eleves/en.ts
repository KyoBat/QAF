## 🎬 Introduction

The four imams have died. But their schools **still live**, 1200 years later.

How is this possible?

Thanks to their **students**: men who not only **preserved** their masters' teachings, but **enriched**, **codified**, and **transmitted** them to future generations.

Without them, the four schools would not exist. They are the **invisible architects** of the fiqh we practice today.

## 🟢 Students of Abū Ḥanīfa: The Companions of Kufa

### The Context

Abū Ḥanīfa **wrote almost nothing**. His teaching was oral, in discussion circles (*ḥalaqāt*) where questions were debated collectively.

His students therefore played a crucial role: **codifying** what the master transmitted orally.

### 🌟 Abū Yūsuf (113-182 AH / 731-798 CE)

**Ya'qūb ibn Ibrāhīm al-Anṣārī**

| **Title** | Qāḍī al-Quḍāt (Chief Justice) |
| **Time with master** | ~17 years |
| **Position** | First Grand Qadi of the Abbasid empire |

#### His Story

Abū Yūsuf was **so poor** that he had to work to survive and missed classes. Abū Ḥanīfa, seeing his talent, told him:

> "Devote yourself to study. I'll take care of your family."

He became the first to officially hold the title of **Qāḍī al-Quḍāt** under Caliph Hārūn al-Rashīd.

#### His Contributions

- 📚 **Kitāb al-Kharāj**: Treatise on Islamic taxation, commissioned by the caliph
- 📚 **Kitāb al-Āthār**: Compilation of legal opinions
- 🏛️ **Institutionalization**: Made the Hanafi school the official law of the Abbasid State

> "I studied with Abū Ḥanīfa for 17 years. I never saw him miss the night prayer."

- **The Egyptian school** (al-madhhab al-jadīd — the new)

His students are therefore distributed between these two periods.

## 🔗 Links Between Schools

The students were not **confined** to their schools. They often studied with teachers from other madhhabs:
