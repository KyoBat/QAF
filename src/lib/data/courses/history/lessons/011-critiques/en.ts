## 🟢 Criticisms Against Abū Ḥanīfa

### Criticism 1: "He Rejects Hadiths"

**The accusation:**

> "Abū Ḥanīfa prefers his ra'y (opinion) over the hadiths of the Prophet ﷺ."

This accusation came mainly from the **Ahl al-Ḥadīth** of the Hijaz.

**The defense:**

1. **He knew the hadiths** but had strict criteria:

<!-- INFOBOX:hanafi-criteria -->

2. **Abū Ḥanīfa's statement:**

> "We take first from the Book of Allah, then the Sunnah, then the decisions of the Companions, then we perform ijtihād."

3. **His students compiled hadiths**: The *Kitāb al-Āthār* of Abū Yūsuf and Muḥammad al-Shaybānī.

---

### Criticism 2: "He Doesn't Have Enough Hadiths"

**The accusation:**

Some claimed he only reported **17 hadiths** with a complete chain.

**The defense:**

1. He was a **jurist**, not a *muḥaddith*. His specialty was **fiqh**, not hadith compilation.

2. He transmitted hadiths through his **students**, who recorded them.

3. The number of hadiths he **used** is far greater than 17.

---

### Criticism 3: "He Was Imprisoned by the Caliph"

**The accusation:**

His imprisonment proves he was **suspect**.

**The defense:**

1. He was imprisoned for **refusing** the position of Qāḍī, not for heresy.

2. This refusal shows his **piety** and fear of misjudging.

> "He preferred prison to the responsibility of judging between people."
> — Ibn 'Abd al-Barr

---

## 🟡 Criticisms Against Mālik

### Criticism 1: "He Limits the Sunnah to Medina"

**The accusation:**

> "Mālik rejects authentic hadiths if they contradict the practice of Medina."

**The defense:**

1. **His reasoning was logical**:

<!-- INFOBOX:malik-logic -->

2. **Medina was unique**: The Prophet's ﷺ city with a living tradition.

3. **He didn't reject hadiths**: He hierarchized them.

---

### Criticism 2: "He Was Beaten for His Opinions"

**The accusation:**

In 147 AH, the governor of Medina had him **flogged** 70 times.

**The defense:**

1. He was beaten for saying that a **forced oath** is invalid (in a fatwa about divorce).

2. This proves his **courage** against authority.

3. After this event, the caliphs **honored** him (like al-Mahdī).

---

### Criticism 3: "Al-Muwaṭṭa' Doesn't Contain Enough Hadiths"

**The accusation:**

With only ~500 marfū' hadiths, it's insufficient.

**The defense:**

1. Mālik **selected** the most authentic hadiths.

2. He included **mawqūfāt** (Companion sayings) and **maqṭū'āt** (Tābi'ī sayings) that show the **living practice**.

3. **Quality over quantity**: al-Shāfi'ī said:

> "After the Book of Allah, there is no book more beneficial than al-Muwaṭṭa'."

---

## 🔵 Criticisms Against al-Shāfi'ī

### Criticism 1: "He Changed His Mind Too Often"

**The accusation:**

> "How can one follow someone who has an old opinion and a contradictory new opinion?"

**The defense:**

1. **Changing one's mind shows intellectual honesty**:

> "When the hadith is authentic, that is my madhhab."
> — al-Shāfi'ī

2. **He traveled and learned**: In Egypt, he discovered new hadiths.

3. **Both opinions are valuable**: They show the process of reflection.

---

### Criticism 2: "He Was Too Harsh with Mālik"

**The accusation:**

In *Ikhtilāf Mālik*, he strongly criticizes his teacher.

**The defense:**

1. **Scientific critique** is not disrespect.

2. He also **praised** Mālik abundantly:

> "Mālik is my teacher and my proof after Allah."

3. The criticism was **methodological**, not personal.

---

### Criticism 3: "He Abandoned the Iraqi Ra'y"

**The accusation:**

After studying with al-Shaybānī, he criticized the Hanafi method.

**The defense:**

2. He established **rules** for ra'y (structured qiyās).

3. His *al-Risāla* is a **bridge** between the two schools.

---

## 🟣 Criticisms Against Aḥmad

### Criticism 1: "He Wasn't Really a Jurist"

**The accusation:**

> "Aḥmad was a muḥaddith, not a faqīh. He didn't write a book of fiqh."

**The defense:**

1. **His fatwas show deep fiqh**: Over 40,000 mas'āla (questions) according to sources.

2. **He refused to write** out of humility:

> "I hate for what comes from me to be written down."

3. **His students compiled**: *Masā'il al-Imām Aḥmad* by his sons Ṣāliḥ and 'Abd Allāh.

---

### Criticism 2: "He Was Too Literalist"

**The accusation:**

> "Aḥmad refused qiyās and followed texts blindly."

**The defense:**

1. **He used qiyās** but as a last resort:

<!-- INFOBOX:ahmad-ranking -->

2. **He preferred a weak hadith** over pure opinion — out of caution.

3. **Ibn Taymiyya defended this approach** as being closest to the Sunnah.

---

### Criticism 3: "The Mihna Proves He Was Extreme"

**The accusation:**

If he had been more **diplomatic**, he would have avoided torture.

**The defense:**

1. **The Mihna was an unjust inquisition**: Scholars were asked to accept a **false** theological position (the created Quran).

2. **He defended the truth** even under torture:

> "Give me a single proof from the Quran or the Sunnah."

3. **His courage saved Sunni doctrine**: Without him, Mu'tazilism might have dominated.

| 🔵 al-Shāfi'ī | "If the hadith contradicts my opinion, throw my opinion against the wall." |
| 🟣 Aḥmad | "Don't follow me blindly. Don't follow Mālik or al-Shāfi'ī. Take from where they took." |
