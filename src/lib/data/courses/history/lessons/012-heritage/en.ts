### University Curricula

<!-- INFOBOX:azhar-curriculum -->

## 🌐 Modern Challenges

### 1. New Questions (Nawāzil)

The 4 madhhabs must answer **unprecedented questions**:

| Question | Challenge |
|----------|-----------|
| **Cryptocurrencies** | Zakāt on Bitcoin? |
| **Artificial Intelligence** | Status of automated contracts? |
| **Medicine** | Organ transplants, IVF? |
| **Finance** | Islamic banking products |
| **Food** | Industrial halal certification |

### 2. Talfīq (Eclecticism)

Can one **mix** opinions from different schools?

<!-- INFOBOX:talfiq-debate -->

### 3. The Salafist Movement

Some call for **abandoning** the madhhabs:

> "Follow the Quran and Sunnah directly"

**Response from traditional scholars:**

> "The madhhabs **are** the Quran and Sunnah understood by experts."

---

## 🤝 Inter-Madhhab Dialogue

### Modern Initiatives

| Initiative | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Amman Message** (2004) | Mutual recognition of 8 legal schools |
| **Fiqh Council of North America** | Collegiate multi-madhhab fatwas |
| **European Council for Fatwa** | Adaptation to minority contexts |
| **Muslim World League** | International coordination |

### Principles of Coexistence

1. **Mutual respect**: Each madhhab is a valid interpretation
2. **No takfīr**: No school excommunicates others
3. **Contextual flexibility**: Possibility to change schools when needed
4. **Priority of unity**: The ummah before the madhhab

---

## 🔮 The Future of the Madhhabs

### Possible Scenarios

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Consolidation** | The 4 madhhabs remain distinct but collaborate |
| **Partial merger** | A "unified Sunni fiqh" emerges for certain questions |
| **Diversification** | New regional "madhhabs" (minority fiqh, etc.) |
| **Stagnation** | Rigid taqlīd without ijtihād |

### What Scholars Recommend

> "**Collective** ijtihād is the way of the future."
> — Yūsuf al-Qaraḍāwī

The idea is to combine:
- The methodological **rigor** of the madhhabs
- **Openness** to new questions
- **Consultation** between scholars of different schools
