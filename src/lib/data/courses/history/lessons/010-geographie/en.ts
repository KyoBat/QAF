## 🎬 Introduction

How is it that today:
- **Morocco** is massively **Maliki**?
- **Indonesia** is almost entirely **Shafi'i**?
- **Turkey** is historically **Hanafi**?
- **Saudi Arabia** is **Hanbali**?

These distributions are not random. They tell a **story of scholars, trade routes, conquests, and political will**.

## 🟢 Hanafi Expansion: The Empire

### The Current Map

| Region | Countries |
|--------|-----------|
| **South Asia** | Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Afghanistan |
| **Central Asia** | Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan |
| **Turkey** | Turkey, Balkans |
| **Middle East** | Iraq, Syria, Palestine |
| **China** | Muslim minority (Hui, Uyghurs) |

### How It Happened?

#### 1. Official Abbasid Adoption (2nd Century AH)

When **Abū Yūsuf** became Qāḍī al-Quḍāt (Chief Justice) under Hārūn al-Rashīd:

> "He appointed Hanafi judges throughout the empire."

The Hanafi school became the **official law** of the Abbasid State, which stretched from Spain to India.

#### 2. The Ottoman Empire (14th-20th Century)

The Ottomans adopted the Hanafi school as the **official state school**:

\`\`\`
THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE (1299-1922)
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Balkans → Anatolia → Middle East     │
│  Egypt → North Africa                  │
│                                        │
│  ⚖️ Official Law: HANAFI              │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
\`\`\`

Judges, schools, and official muftis were **all Hanafi**.

#### 3. The Mughal Empire (16th-19th Century)

In India, the Mughals also imposed the Hanafi school:

> **Fatāwā 'Ālamgīriyya**: A Hanafi fiqh compilation commissioned by Emperor Aurangzeb.

#### 4. The Silk Roads

Merchants from Baghdad and Central Asia traveled the Silk Roads, carrying Hanafi fiqh to **China**.

## 🟡 Maliki Expansion: The Maghreb and Africa

### The Current Map

| Region | Countries |
|--------|-----------|
| **Maghreb** | Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya |
| **West Africa** | Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Nigeria |
| **Spain (historical)** | Al-Andalus |
| **Egypt (partial)** | Upper Egypt |
| **Sudan** | Sudan |

### How It Happened?

#### 1. Maghrebi Students

Students from North Africa came to **Medina** to study with Mālik:

- **Saḥnūn** from Kairouan
- **Ibn al-Qāsim** from Egypt (Egypt close to Maghreb)
- **Yaḥyā al-Laythī** from Al-Andalus

They returned home and **taught** what they had learned.

#### 2. The Aghlabid Decision (3rd Century AH)

The **Aghlabids** of Kairouan (modern Tunisia) adopted the Maliki school as official law:

> "Saḥnūn was appointed Chief Judge of Kairouan in 234 AH."

#### 3. The Almoravids and Almohads

These Berber dynasties spread the Maliki school throughout the **Maghreb** and **Al-Andalus**:

\`\`\`

#### 4. Trans-Saharan Routes

Merchants and scholars crossing the **Sahara** carried the Maliki school to:
- Timbuktu (Mali)
- Kano (Nigeria)
- Senegal and Mauritania

## 🔵 Shafi'i Expansion: The Oceans

### The Current Map

| Region | Countries |
|--------|-----------|
| **Southeast Asia** | Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Philippines (south) |
| **East Africa** | Somalia, Djibouti, Comoros, Swahili coast |
| **Middle East** | Egypt (Lower Egypt), Yemen, Kurdistan |
| **Caucasus** | Dagestan, Chechnya |

### How It Happened?

#### 1. Egypt: The Base

Al-Shāfi'ī died in **Egypt** (204 AH). His students established a strong presence there:

> "Al-Shāfi'ī's tomb in Cairo is still a pilgrimage site."

Egypt became the **center** of the Shafi'i school.

#### 2. The Ayyubids (12th Century)

**Saladin** (Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn al-Ayyūbī) was Shafi'i. He:
- Built Shafi'i madrasas
- Appointed Shafi'i judges
- Strengthened the madhhab in Egypt and the Levant

#### 3. Maritime Routes

This is the **great particularity** of the Shafi'i school: **maritime** merchants spread this madhhab:

\`\`\`

     Yemen ──────────────────────────────────┐

       ▼                                     ▼
  East Africa                         Southeast Asia
  (Swahili, Somalia)                (Indonesia, Malaysia)
       │                                     │
       ▼                                     ▼
   Comoros                              Philippines
   Madagascar                              Brunei
\`\`\`

**Yemeni merchants** (Ḥaḍramawt) were almost all Shafi'i. They settled:
- On the **Swahili** coast (Kenya, Tanzania)
- In **Indonesia** (Java, Sumatra)
- In **Malaysia**

#### 4. Southeast Asian Sultanates

Sultanates like **Malacca**, **Aceh**, and **Mataram** adopted the Shafi'i as official law.

> Indonesia (250 million inhabitants) is the **largest Muslim country** — and it is massively Shafi'i.

## 🟣 Hanbali Expansion: The Heart of Arabia

### The Current Map

| Region | Countries |
|--------|-----------|
| **Arabia** | Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Emirates (parts) |
| **Historical** | Baghdad, Syria (minority) |

### Why So Limited?

The Hanbali school remained **minority** for a long time because:
1. Aḥmad refused official positions
2. No adoption by a great empire (before the Saudis)
3. Strong theological resistance

### How It Happened?

#### 1. Baghdad: The Base

Aḥmad died in **Baghdad** (241 AH). His students maintained a presence there, but as a minority against the official Hanafis.

#### 2. Revitalization by Ibn Taymiyya (14th Century)

**Ibn Taymiyya** (661-728 AH) revived the Hanbali school:
- Criticized innovations
- Called for return to texts
- Trained **Ibn al-Qayyim**, who continued his work

#### 3. The Wahhabi Movement (18th Century)

**Muḥammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhāb** allied with the **Saud** family:

\`\`\`
THE SAUDI-WAHHABI ALLIANCE (1744)
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Muḥammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhāb          │
│  (Hanbali reformer)                   │
│              +                         │
│  Muḥammad ibn Sa'ūd                   │
│  (Emir of Dir'iyya)                   │
│              ↓                         │
│     FIRST SAUDI STATE                  │
│     Official Hanbali madhhab           │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
\`\`\`

#### 4. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (20th Century)

With the creation of the Kingdom in 1932, the Hanbali school became:
- The **official law** of the country
- The basis of the **Holy Places** (Mecca and Medina)
- Exported through **funding** of mosques worldwide

## 📊 Summary Table

| School | Main Zone | Vector of Expansion | Key Era |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| 🟢 Hanafi | Central Asia, Subcontinent, Turkey | Empires (Abbasids, Ottomans, Mughals) | 2nd-10th century AH |
| 🟡 Maliki | Maghreb, West Africa | Students + Trans-Saharan trade | 3rd-7th century AH |
| 🔵 Shafi'i | Southeast Asia, East Africa | Maritime trade (Yemen) | 7th-10th century AH |
| 🟣 Hanbali | Arabian Peninsula | Political alliance (Saudis) | 12th-14th century AH |

---

## 🔀 Fluid Boundaries

### Mixed Zones

Some regions have known several madhhabs:

| Region | Madhhabs Present |
|--------|------------------|
| **Egypt** | Shafi'i (dominant), Maliki, Hanafi (Ottoman official) |
| **Syria** | Hanafi, Shafi'i, Hanbali |
| **Yemen** | Shafi'i (dominant), Zaydi (Shi'ite) |
| **India** | Hanafi (dominant), Shafi'i (coasts) |

### Historical Changes

| Region | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Egypt | Maliki (Fatimids) | Shafi'i (Ayyubids) |
| Iraq | Mixed | Hanafi (Ottomans) |
| Andalus | Maliki | Disappeared (Reconquista) |

---

## 💡 Lessons from This Geography

### 1. The Role of Power

**Official** adoption by a state was the **most powerful** factor of expansion.

### 2. The Role of Trade

**Merchants** were silent but effective vectors (Shafi'i maritime, Maliki trans-Saharan).

### 3. The Role of Students

Students who **returned** home spread what they had learned (Maliki in Maghreb).

### 4. Permanence

Once established, a madhhab tends to **persist** for centuries. Morocco has been Maliki for 1200 years.
