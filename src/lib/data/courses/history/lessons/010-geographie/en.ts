## 📖 Introduction

How is it that today:
- **Morocco** is massively **Maliki**?
- **Indonesia** is almost entirely **Shafi'i**?
- **Turkey** is historically **Hanafi**?
- **Saudi Arabia** is **Hanbali**?

These distributions are not random. They tell a **story of scholars, trade routes, conquests, and political will**.

## 🟢 Hanafi Expansion: The Empire

### The Current Map

| Region | Countries |
|--------|-----------|
| **South Asia** | Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Afghanistan |
| **Central Asia** | Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan |
| **Turkey** | Turkey, Balkans |
| **Middle East** | Iraq, Syria, Palestine |
| **China** | Muslim minority (Hui, Uyghurs) |

### How It Happened?

#### 1. Official Abbasid Adoption (2nd Century AH)

When **Abū Yūsuf** became Qāḍī al-Quḍāt (Chief Justice) under Hārūn al-Rashīd:

> "He appointed Hanafi judges throughout the empire."

The Hanafi school became the **official law** of the Abbasid State, which stretched from Spain to India.

<!-- EXPANSION:hanafi -->

Judges, schools, and official muftis were **all Hanafi**.

## 🟡 Maliki Expansion: The Maghreb and Africa

### The Current Map

| Region | Countries |
|--------|-----------|
| **Maghreb** | Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya |
| **West Africa** | Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Nigeria |
| **Spain (historical)** | Al-Andalus |
| **Egypt (partial)** | Upper Egypt |
| **Sudan** | Sudan |

### How It Happened?

#### 1. Maghrebi Students

Students from North Africa came to **Medina** to study with Mālik:

- **Saḥnūn** from Kairouan
- **Ibn al-Qāsim** from Egypt (Egypt close to Maghreb)
- **Yaḥyā al-Laythī** from Al-Andalus

They returned home and **taught** what they had learned.

#### 2. The Aghlabid Decision (3rd Century AH)

The **Aghlabids** of Kairouan (modern Tunisia) adopted the Maliki school as official law:

> "Saḥnūn was appointed Chief Judge of Kairouan in 234 AH."

<!-- EXPANSION:maliki -->

## 🔵 Shafi'i Expansion: The Oceans

### The Current Map

| Region | Countries |
|--------|-----------|
| **Southeast Asia** | Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Philippines (south) |
| **East Africa** | Somalia, Djibouti, Comoros, Swahili coast |
| **Middle East** | Egypt (Lower Egypt), Yemen, Kurdistan |
| **Caucasus** | Dagestan, Chechnya |

### How It Happened?

#### 1. Egypt: The Base

Al-Shāfi'ī died in **Egypt** (204 AH). His students established a strong presence there:

> "Al-Shāfi'ī's tomb in Cairo is still a pilgrimage site."

Egypt became the **center** of the Shafi'i school.

#### 2. The Ayyubids (12th Century)

**Saladin** (Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn al-Ayyūbī) was Shafi'i. He:
- Built Shafi'i madrasas
- Appointed Shafi'i judges
- Strengthened the madhhab in Egypt and the Levant

<!-- EXPANSION:shafii -->

> Indonesia (250 million inhabitants) is the **largest Muslim country** — and it is massively Shafi'i.

## 🟣 Hanbali Expansion: The Heart of Arabia

### The Current Map

| Region | Countries |
|--------|-----------|
| **Arabia** | Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Emirates (parts) |
| **Historical** | Baghdad, Syria (minority) |

### Why So Limited?

The Hanbali school remained **minority** for a long time because:
1. Aḥmad refused official positions
2. No adoption by a great empire (before the Saudis)
3. Strong theological resistance

### How It Happened?

#### 1. Baghdad: The Base

Aḥmad died in **Baghdad** (241 AH). His students maintained a presence there, but as a minority against the official Hanafis.

<!-- EXPANSION:hanbali -->

## 💡 Lessons from This Geography

### 1. The Role of Power

**Official** adoption by a state was the **most powerful** factor of expansion.

### 2. The Role of Trade

**Merchants** were silent but effective vectors (Shafi'i maritime, Maliki trans-Saharan).

### 3. The Role of Students

Students who **returned** home spread what they had learned (Maliki in Maghreb).

### 4. Permanence

Once established, a madhhab tends to **persist** for centuries. Morocco has been Maliki for 1200 years.
