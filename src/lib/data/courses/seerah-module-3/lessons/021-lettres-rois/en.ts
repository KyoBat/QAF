### The Interrogation of Abû Sufyân

> 
> | Question | Abû Sufyân's Answer |
> |----------|---------------------|
> | What is his lineage among you? | Of the noblest lineage |
> | Has anyone said this before him? | No |
> | Does he betray? | No, and we are in a truce not knowing what he will do |
> | Who follows him? | The weak people |
> | Are they increasing or decreasing? | Increasing |

### Heraclius's Analysis

> 🎭 **Scene**:
> 
> Heraclius said:
> 
> "I asked you about his lineage, and you mentioned he is of noble lineage among you. Thus are messengers sent, in the lineage of their people.
> 
> I asked if anyone had said this before him, and you said no. If someone had said it before him, I would have said he is imitating words said before him.
> 
> I asked if he betrays, and you mentioned he does not betray. Thus messengers do not betray.
> 
> If what you say is true, he will rule the place where my feet are now. If I were near him, I would wash his feet!"
> 
> — **Source: Sahîh al-Bukhârî**

### Heraclius's Position

Heraclius did not convert publicly for fear of losing his kingdom, but he knew he was a true prophet.

> 
> **"May Allah tear up his kingdom!"**
