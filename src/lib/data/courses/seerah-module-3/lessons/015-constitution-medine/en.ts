## 🌍 The Reality of Medina Before the Constitution

When the Prophet ﷺ arrived in Medina, he found a diverse and complex society:

### The Arab Tribes

| Tribe | Affiliation | Position |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| The Aws | Ansar | Majority Muslims |
| The Khazraj | Ansar | Majority Muslims |
| Aws and Khazraj | Ancient enmity | War of Bu'ath years earlier |

### The Jewish Tribes

| Tribe | Profession | Location |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Banū Qaynuqā' | Goldsmithing and forging | Central Medina |
| Banū an-Nadīr | Agriculture and trade | Outskirts of Medina |
| Banū Qurayza | Weapons manufacturing | South of Medina |

### The Hypocrites

> 🎭 **Scene**:
> 
> 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy ibn Salūl was on the verge of being crowned king of Medina when Islam came and disrupted his plans. He entered Islam outwardly, but his heart seethed with resentment and hatred.
> 
> — **Source: Sīra of Ibn Hishām**

## 📋 The Need to Organize Society

The Prophet ﷺ realized that building a strong state was impossible without:

1. **A clear law** governing relationships
2. **Justice** that encompasses everyone
3. **Coexistence** among different components
4. **Common defense** against enemies

> 🎭 **Scene of the Foundation**:
> 
> The Prophet ﷺ sat with the notables of the Muhājirīn, the Ansar, and the chiefs of the Jewish tribes. He unrolled a long scroll before them and said:
> 
> "This is a document from Muhammad the Prophet, between the believers and Muslims of Quraysh and Yathrib, and those who followed them, joined them, and fought alongside them..."
> 
> — **Source: Sīra of Ibn Hishām**

## 📖 The Text of the Constitution and Its Principles

### First Principle: One Nation

> **"They are one nation to the exclusion of all other people"**

This is the first declaration in history placing the bond of faith above tribal and ethnic bonds.

### Second Principle: Equality of Rights and Duties

> **"The believers are allies of one another to the exclusion of others"**

| Right | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| Freedom of belief | Jews have their religion, Muslims have theirs |
| Freedom of trade | Everyone trades freely |
| Right to judicial recourse | The Prophet ﷺ judges disputes |
| Right to security | No one is oppressed, no oppressor is supported |

### Third Principle: Social Solidarity

> **"The believers ransom their captives with equity and justice among Muslims"**

- Ransoming prisoners
- Supporting the oppressed
- Sheltering the weak

### Fourth Principle: Common Defense

> **"Between them exists mutual support against whoever attacks the people of this constitution"**

| Clause | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Mutual support | Everyone defends Medina |
| Prohibition of betrayal | No one protects an idolater from Quraysh |
| Peace and war | If called to peace, all respond together |

### Fifth Principle: Supreme Authority

> **"Whatever dispute or conflict arises among the people of this constitution, whose consequences are feared, shall be referred to Allah and to Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ"**

## 🏛️ Practical Applications of the Constitution

### Story of the First Application

> 🎭 **Scene**:
> 
> A man from Banū Qaynuqā' came to complain to the Prophet ﷺ that a man from the Ansar had wronged him in a commercial transaction.
> 
> The Prophet ﷺ examined the matter, then ruled in favor of the Jew against the Muslim, ordering him to fully restore his due.
> 
> The Jew exclaimed in amazement: "I have never seen a more just man than this one!"
> 
> — **Source: Dalā'il an-Nubuwwa of al-Bayhaqī**

### The Market and Trade

| Banū Qaynuqā' Market | Muslims' Market |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| High taxes | No taxes |
| Monopoly | Free trade |
| Usury | Prohibition of usury |
