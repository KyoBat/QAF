## 🔍 Lessons from the Battle of Uhud

### First Lesson: Obedience to Command

> **﴿ And obey Allah and the Messenger that you may obtain mercy ﴾**
> — **[Surah Âl-'Imrân: 132]**

The archers' disobedience to the Prophet's ﷺ order was the cause of the battle's reversal.

### Second Lesson: Love of This World is Dangerous

The archers left their positions out of desire for spoils, and lost the victory.

### Third Lesson: Trial is a Divine Law

> **﴿ Or do you think that you will enter Paradise while Allah has not yet distinguished those of you who fight in His cause and distinguished the steadfast ﴾**
> — **[Surah Âl-'Imrân: 142]**

### Fourth Lesson: Purification of the Ranks

Trial distinguishes the sincere believer from the hypocrite.
