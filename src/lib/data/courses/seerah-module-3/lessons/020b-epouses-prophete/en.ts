  content: `# 👑 The Wives of the Prophet ﷺ — أُمَّهَات المُؤْمِنِين

## Introduction

> "The Prophet is more worthy of the believers than themselves, and his wives are their mothers."
> 
> — **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:6)**

The wives of the Prophet ﷺ were not merely women he married. They are the **Mothers of the Believers** (Ummahāt al-Mu'minīn), a Quranic title conferring upon them a unique status in human history. Each marriage had a **divine wisdom**: political, social, humanitarian, or legislative.

Imam adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his *Siyar A'lām an-Nubalā'*: "His marriages were alliances, protection for widows, legislative examples, and schools for transmitting knowledge."

## 👑 1. Khadijah bint Khuwaylid (may Allah be pleased with her) — The First and Only

### 1.1 Her Exceptional Status

Khadijah holds an **unparalleled** position among the wives. The Prophet ﷺ loved her with such deep love that even after her death, he continuously mentioned her.

**'Aisha narrated**:
> "I was never jealous of any of the Prophet's wives as I was of Khadijah, though I never saw her. But he used to mention her so often! And whenever he slaughtered a sheep, he would send portions to Khadijah's friends. I once said to him: 'It's as if there is no other woman in the world except Khadijah!' He replied: 'She was this and that... and I had children from her.'"
> 
> — **Sahih al-Bukhari (3818) and Muslim (2435)**

### 1.2 Her Unique Virtues

1. **First believer**: She believed before all men
2. **Financial support**: Her wealth in service of Islam
3. **Emotional support**: "Never! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you!"
4. **Mother of his offspring**: All his children except Ibrahim
5. **Greetings from Allah**: Jibril conveyed Allah's salām to her

**Hadith**:
> "Jibril came to the Prophet ﷺ and said: 'O Messenger of Allah! Here is Khadijah coming to you with a container of food and drink. When she reaches you, convey to her greetings of peace from her Lord and from me, and give her glad tidings of a palace in Paradise made of hollow pearls, wherein there will be neither noise nor fatigue.'"
> 
> — **Sahih al-Bukhari (3820) and Muslim (2432)**

### 1.3 Her Death — The Year of Sorrow

Khadijah died in **619 CE**, the same year as Abu Talib. The Prophet ﷺ called this period **'Ām al-Ḥuzn** (عام الحُزن — the Year of Sorrow). He lost his emotional support (Khadijah) and social protection (Abu Talib) simultaneously.

### 2.2 Her Eloquence and Poetry

Abu Musa al-Ash'ari reported:
> "Never did a hadith pose difficulty to us, the companions of the Prophet ﷺ, except that when we asked 'Aisha, we found she had knowledge of it."

### 2.3 The Prophet's Love for Her

'Amr ibn al-'As asked the Prophet ﷺ:

> — **Sahih al-Bukhari (3662) and Muslim (2384)**

### 2.4 The Ifk Incident (The Slander)

One of the most painful trials was the **slander** launched by the hypocrites against 'Aisha after the Banu Mustaliq expedition.

- **For a month**, the Prophet ﷺ suffered in silence
- **Divine revelation**: Allah exonerated 'Aisha through 10 Quranic verses (Surah An-Nur 24:11-21)

### 3.1 Her Status

Daughter of 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, she became a widow after her husband Khunays ibn Hudhafah was martyred at Badr. 'Umar offered her hand to Abu Bakr then to 'Uthman, who declined. The Prophet ﷺ married her, consolidating the alliance with 'Umar.

After the Quran's compilation under Abu Bakr, the **original Mushaf** was entrusted to Hafsa. It was from this Mushaf that 'Uthman made the official copies.

The Prophet ﷺ followed her counsel. Seeing him, the companions immediately followed suit.

**Lesson**: The importance of women's counsel in major decisions.

### 4.2 Her Famous Du'a

When her husband Abu Salamah died, she said the du'a he had taught her:

Zaynab was the Prophet's **cousin** (daughter of his aunt Umaymah). She was married to **Zayd ibn Haritha**, the Prophet's former adopted slave.

The marriage was difficult due to social status differences. Zayd repeatedly requested divorce. Finally, Allah revealed:

> "So when Zayd had no longer any need for her, We married her to you, so that there would not be upon the believers any discomfort concerning the wives of their adopted sons when they no longer have need of them."

3. **Test for the Prophet ﷺ**: He feared public opinion but obeyed Allah

### 5.3 Her Legitimate Pride

The Prophet ﷺ offered better: **he paid her ransom and married her**.

### 6.2 Extraordinary Impact

**'Aisha narrated**:
> "When the Muslims heard that the Prophet ﷺ had married Juwayriyah, they said: 'They are now the in-laws of the Messenger of Allah!' They then freed all the captives they held. Her marriage caused the liberation of **one hundred families** of Banu Mustaliq. I know of no woman more blessed for her people than her."
