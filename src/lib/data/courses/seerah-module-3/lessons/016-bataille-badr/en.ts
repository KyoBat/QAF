## 🎯 Preparation and Consultation

### The Prophet ﷺ Learns of the Caravan

> 🎭 **Scene**:
> 
> News reached the Prophet ﷺ that a large Quraysh caravan led by Abû Sufyân was passing near Medina, carrying considerable wealth.

### The Military Consultation

The Prophet ﷺ consulted his companions, and three of them spoke immortal words:

**Abû Bakr as-Siddîq رضي الله عنه:**
> "Proceed, O Messenger of Allah, to what Allah has commanded you. We are with you."

**'Umar ibn al-Khattâb رضي الله عنه:**
> "O Messenger of Allah, it is Quraysh and its might. By Allah, it has never been humbled since it rose to power, and has never believed since it disbelieved. But we will fight alongside you."

**Al-Miqdâd ibn 'Amr رضي الله عنه:**
> 🎭 **Scene**:
> 
> "O Messenger of Allah, proceed to what Allah has shown you, we are with you. By Allah, we will not say to you as the Children of Israel said to Moses: 'Go, you and your Lord, and fight; we are staying here.' Rather, we say: 'Go, you and your Lord, and fight; we will fight with you!'"
> 
> The Prophet's ﷺ face lit up with joy.

**Sa'd ibn Mu'âdh رضي الله عنه (Chief of the Ansar):**
> 🎭 **Scene**:
> 
> "O Messenger of Allah, we have believed in you and confirmed your truthfulness. Go wherever you wish, we are with you. By Him who sent you with the truth, if you were to lead us into that sea and plunge into it, we would plunge in with you—not a single man among us would stay behind!"

## 📊 The Balance of Forces

### The Massive Disparity

| Element | Muslims | Quraysh |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Numbers | 313 men | 1,000 fighters |
| Cavalry | 2 horses only | 100 horses |
| Camels | 70 camels | 700 camels |
| Armor | Very little | Fully equipped |

### The Muslim Camp

Al-Hubâb ibn al-Mundhir chose a strategic position:

> 🎭 **Scene**:
> 
> Al-Hubâb said: "O Messenger of Allah, is this location a place Allah has commanded you to occupy, from which we must neither advance nor retreat, or is it a matter of opinion, strategy, and tactics?"
> 
> He ﷺ replied: "It is rather a matter of opinion, strategy, and tactics."
> 
> He said: "Then this is not the right location. Let us proceed to the water source closest to the enemy, camp there, then fill in the other wells behind us."
> 
> The Prophet ﷺ said: "You have given sound advice."

## 🌙 The Night Before the Battle

### The Prophet's ﷺ Supplication

> 🎭 **Scene**:
> 
> The Prophet ﷺ stood praying and supplicating throughout the night, raising his hands to the sky:
> 
> "O Allah! If You destroy this group, You will not be worshipped on earth!"
> 
> He continued supplicating until his cloak fell from his shoulders. Abû Bakr came, held him from behind, replaced his cloak, and said:
> 
> "That is enough, O Messenger of Allah! You have pleaded enough with your Lord!"
> 
> — **Source: Sahîh Muslim**

### The Descent of the Angels

> **﴿ When you were seeking help from your Lord, and He answered you: "I will reinforce you with a thousand angels following one another" ﴾**
> — **[Surah Al-Anfâl: 9]**

The Prophet ﷺ announced to his companions:
> "Rejoice! Here is Jibrîl holding the reins of his horse, clad in his war equipment."
