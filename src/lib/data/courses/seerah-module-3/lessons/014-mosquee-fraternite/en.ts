## 📢 The Adhan — The Call from Heaven

I said: We will call to prayer with it. He said: Shall I not guide you to something better? I said: Yes. He said: You say:*
>
> **Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar...**"
>

## 🤝 The Mu'akhat — The Greatest Social Experiment

### The Problem

The Muhajirin arrived in Medina having left everything in Mecca:
- **No money** — confiscated by Quraysh
- **No houses** — left behind
- **No work** — they didn't know agriculture
- **No family** — all their relatives in Mecca

---

### The Prophetic Solution: Brotherhood

> 📜 **The Scene**:
>
> The Prophet ﷺ gathered the Muhajirin and Ansar in the house of Anas ibn Malik رضي الله عنه. He stood among them and said:
>
> *"Form brotherhood for Allah's sake, two by two"*
>
> Then he established brotherhood between them — each Muhajir with an Ansari — until they reached **90 men**: 45 Muhajirin and 45 Ansar.

---

### Immortal Examples of Brotherhood

#### 1. 'Abd ar-Rahman ibn 'Awf and Sa'd ibn ar-Rabi'

> 📜 **The Scene**:
>
> The Prophet ﷺ established brotherhood between **'Abd ar-Rahman ibn 'Awf** (the Muhajir) and **Sa'd ibn ar-Rabi'** (the Ansari).
>
> Sa'd said to 'Abd ar-Rahman: *"My brother! I am the wealthiest of the people of Medina. Look at half of my wealth and take it! And I have two wives, look at which one pleases you more so I can divorce her for you!"*
>
> 'Abd ar-Rahman said: *"May Allah bless your family and your wealth! Show me the market"*
>
> He went to the market, bought and sold, until he became one of the wealthiest Companions! He married a woman from the Ansar for the weight of a date stone in gold.

---

#### 2. Abu Bakr and Kharija ibn Zayd

| Muhajir | Ansari |
|---------|--------|
| Abu Bakr as-Siddiq | Kharija ibn Zayd |

---

#### 3. 'Ali ibn Abi Talib... and the Prophet ﷺ!

> 📜 **The Scene**:
>
> When the Prophet ﷺ established brotherhood between the Companions, 'Ali رضي الله عنه remained without a brother. His eyes filled with tears.
>
> The Prophet ﷺ said to him: *"Are you not satisfied to be to me what Aaron was to Moses, except that there is no prophet after me? You are my brother in this world and the Hereafter"*
