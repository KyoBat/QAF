## 📖 Introduction

### A World Awaiting Light

Imagine a world where:
- **Two colossal empires** had been clashing for centuries: the Persians and the Romans
- **A desert peninsula** between them, considered by all to be **worthless**
- **Scattered tribes** with no state or king to unite them
- **A small town** in the heart of the desert called **Mecca**

In this forgotten place, Allah was preparing **the greatest transformation** in human history.

But to understand the greatness of what the Prophet ﷺ brought, we must first know **how the world was before him**.
