## 📖 The Seven Conditions of Prayer

All praise is due to Allah who prescribed prayer and perfected its boundaries. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad who said: **"No prayer is accepted without purification"** — Reported by Muslim. We praise Him for clarifying the conditions of this great act of worship before delving into its pillars and actions.

> Allah تعالى says: **﴾ They were only commanded to worship Allah, being sincere to Him in religion ﴿** (Al-Bayyina: 5). Sincerity and following are two foundations without which no deed is valid, and this is not achieved in prayer except by fulfilling its conditions.

## 🔍 Definition of condition and distinction from pillar

- **Condition (shart):** What is required before and during the act of worship, not being part of its essence, and whose absence invalidates the act (like purification).
- **Pillar (rukn):** A part of the very essence of the worship, without which the act is invalid (like prostration).
- **Obligation (wajib):** What the Legislator has commanded, whose forgetful omission is compensated by the prostration of forgetfulness.

The conditions are seven according to the recognized opinion among the majority of jurists (particularly the Hanbalis and Malikis in their summaries), and they precede every prayer.

## 📚 Table of conditions with proofs and practical applications

| Condition | Brief Definition | Authentic Proof | Practical Verification |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **1. Islam** | Prayer is not accepted from a disbeliever | Allah تعالى says: **﴾ Whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted from him ﴿** (Al-Imran: 85) | Renew the testimony of faith, remain firm upon correct belief |
| **2. Sanity** | The obligation falls from the insane | Hadith "The pen is lifted from three... and the insane until he regains sanity" — Abu Dawud (4403) | Ensure mental soundness at the time of prayer |
| **3. Discernment** | Reaching the age of understanding (around 7 years) | Continuation of previous hadith: "and the child until puberty" | Teach children and prepare them from age seven (hadith Bukhari 587) |
| **4. Purification from hadath and khabath** | Ablution or ritual bath and removal of impurities | The Prophet ﷺ said: "No prayer is accepted without purification" — Muslim (224); Allah says: **﴾ And your garments, purify them ﴿** (Al-Muddathir: 4) | Correct ablution, checking clothes and location |
| **5. Covering the 'awra** | Covering what must be covered during prayer | Allah تعالى says: **﴾ O children of Adam, take your adornment at every mosque ﴿** (Al-A'raf: 31); hadith "Allah does not accept the prayer of a woman who has reached puberty without a head covering" — Abu Dawud (641) | Covering garment that is not transparent, respecting legal standards |
| **6. Entry of time** | Performing prayer after the entry of its prescribed time | Allah تعالى says: **﴾ Indeed, prayer has been decreed upon the believers at specified times ﴿** (An-Nisa: 103); hadith of Jibril on prayer times — Tirmidhi (149) | Rely on the approved calendar or observe cosmic signs |
| **7. Facing the Qibla** | Turning toward the Ka'ba for one who is able | Allah تعالى says: **﴾ Turn your face toward the Sacred Mosque ﴿** (Al-Baqara: 144); hadith of the one who prayed badly: "When you stand for prayer, perfect your ablution then face the Qibla and say the takbir" — Bukhari (724) | Use compass or reliable applications, align rows in congregation |

## ⚖️ Brief jurisprudential points

1. **Purification includes removing hadath and eliminating khabath:** This includes ablution, ritual bath, tayammum when unable, and cleaning the garment, body, and place.
2. **Covering the 'awra differs by gender:**
   - Man: what is between the navel and knees, with shoulders in congregational prayer.
   - Woman: the entire body except face and hands, avoiding tight and transparent clothing.
3. **One unable to face the Qibla:** Like a traveler on a ship or a patient in bed, prays according to his ability as Allah تعالى says: **﴾ Fear Allah as much as you can ﴿** (At-Taghabun: 16).
4. **Time is the most critical condition:** Prayer is not valid before its entry by consensus. Exception for the sleeper and forgetful who make it up upon waking or remembering (hadith Muslim 684).

## 🎓 Comparison of Schools on Covering the 'Awra

### 📌 Man's 'awra in prayer

| School | Extent of 'awra | Proof | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|-------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | Between navel and knees; navel and knees are not 'awra | Hadith: "Cover your thigh" — Ahmad | Covering shoulders is recommended but not obligatory |
| 🟢 **Hanafi** | Between navel and knees; knee is 'awra but not navel | Taking precaution, knee is included | They took the cautious approach |
| 🔵 **Shafi'i** | Between navel and knees; neither is 'awra | Hadith of Anas about the Prophet's ﷺ thigh — Bukhari | Obligation to cover one shoulder in congregation |
| 🟣 **Hanbali** | Between navel and knees; thigh is 'awra | Hadith: "The thigh is 'awra" — Ahmad and Tirmidhi | Safest to cover what is between them |

> 📌 **Preferred view:** Best to follow the majority while covering shoulders in congregational prayer as precaution.

### 📌 Woman's 'awra in prayer

| School | Extent of 'awra | Status of face and hands | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------------------------|-------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | Entire body except face and hands | Not part of 'awra | Uncovering feet is disliked |
| 🟢 **Hanafi** | Entire body except face, hands, and feet | Feet are not 'awra in prayer | For ease on women |
| 🔵 **Shafi'i** | Entire body except face and hands | Not part of 'awra | Recommended to cover top of feet |
| 🟣 **Hanbali** | Entire body except face only | Hands are part of 'awra in prayer | Most cautious view |

> 📌 **Maliki view retained:** Face and hands are not 'awra in prayer. It is recommended for women to cover their feet to exit from disagreement.

## 🔷 Schools' Views on Praying with Impurity by Forgetfulness

| School | Ruling | Proof | Reasoning |
|--------|--------|-------|-----------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | Does not repeat if time has passed; repeats within time by recommendation | Removing hardship from the forgetful | Time is a stronger condition than removing impurity |
| 🟢 **Hanafi** | Repeats in all cases | Purification is a condition not dropped by forgetfulness | Caution for worship |
| 🔵 **Shafi'i** | Repeats in all cases according to the recognized view | By analogy with leaving a condition | No difference between intentional and forgetful |
| 🟣 **Hanbali** | Does not repeat if only knew after prayer | Hadith of removing sandals — Abu Dawud | The Prophet ﷺ did not restart the prayer |

> 📌 **Chosen view:** One who prayed with impurity unknowingly or forgetfully and only knew after prayer, his prayer is valid. This is the view of Malikis and Hanbalis.

## 🎯 Practical application for youth

- **Prayer verification card:**
  1. Did I make ablution according to the guidance of the Prophet ﷺ?
  2. Is my garment clean and covering?
  3. Did I verify the entry of time?
  4. Did I ensure the direction of the Qibla?
- **Pre-prayer supplications:** Supplication for guidance and steadfastness: *"O Allah, make me one who establishes prayer, and from my descendants"* — (Ibrahim: 40).
- **Family reminder:** Place a sign at the house door "Check the conditions of your prayer" for the whole family to participate.

## ❓ Self-review questions

1. How do you distinguish between a condition and a pillar?
2. What is the proof for the obligation of covering the 'awra for prayer?
3. What should one do who forgot an impurity on his garment and only discovered it after prayer? (He repeats the prayer according to the majority of scholars).
4. When does the condition of facing the Qibla fall away?

> **Golden rule:** *The more you care for the conditions of prayer, the more your heart is prepared to stand before Allah.*
