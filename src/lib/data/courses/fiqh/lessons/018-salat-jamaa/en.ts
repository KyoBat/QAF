## 🎬 OPENING SCENE — The Desert of Isolation

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 The Man Who Prayed Alone**

*A blind man came to see the Prophet ﷺ...*

*He walked with difficulty, leaning on a stick through the sandy streets of Medina...*

**The Blind Man:** "O Messenger of Allah, I have no one to guide me to the mosque. The streets are dangerous at night. Can I pray at home?"

*The Prophet ﷺ, known for his mercy, gave him permission...*

*The man turned, relieved, and began to leave...*

*But suddenly...*

**The Prophet ﷺ:** "Come back!"

*The blind man stopped, worried. Had he done something wrong?*

**The Prophet ﷺ:** **"Do you hear the call to prayer?"**

**The Blind Man:** "Yes, O Messenger of Allah."

**The Prophet ﷺ:** **"فَأَجِبْ — Then respond to it."**

*No exception. Not even for a blind man without a guide.*

</div>

**📍 Source:** Sahih Muslim (653), Abu Dawud (552)

> 💡 **The striking lesson:** If even the blind man must come, what about those with two eyes and two legs?

## 📜 Foundational Texts (النصوص الأساسية)

### The Quran — The Divine Command

> **﴿ وَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتُوا الزَّكَاةَ وَارْكَعُوا مَعَ الرَّاكِعِينَ ﴾**
> *"And establish prayer, give zakah, and **bow with those who bow**."*
> — [Al-Baqarah: 43]

> 📌 **Exegetical note:** "مَعَ الرَّاكِعِينَ" (with those who bow) = in congregation, not alone.

> **﴿ وَإِذَا كُنتَ فِيهِمْ فَأَقَمْتَ لَهُمُ الصَّلَاةَ فَلْتَقُمْ طَائِفَةٌ مِّنْهُم مَّعَكَ ﴾**
> *"And when you are among them and lead them in prayer, let a group of them stand with you."*
> — [An-Nisa: 102]

> 💡 **Reflection:** Even in war, under enemy arrows, Allah commands congregational prayer (Salat al-Khawf).

### The Sunnah — Foundational Hadiths

#### 1️⃣ The Hadith of the 27 Degrees

> Narrated by **Abu Hurayra** رضي الله عنه that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:
> **« صَلَاةُ الْجَمَاعَةِ أَفْضَلُ مِنْ صَلَاةِ أَحَدِكُمْ وَحْدَهُ بِسَبْعٍ وَعِشْرِينَ دَرَجَةً »**
> *"Congregational prayer is superior to individual prayer by **twenty-seven degrees**."*
> — Sahih Al-Bukhari (645), Sahih Muslim (650)

<div class="scene-box">

**📊 Spiritual Calculation:**

| Type of Prayer | Reward | Multiplication |
|----------------|--------|----------------|
| Alone at home | 1x | Base reward |
| In congregation at mosque | 27x | **2700% more!** |

*It's as if you prayed 27 times instead of once!*

</div>

---

#### 2️⃣ The Hadith of the Threat — Burning the Houses!

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 The Prophet's Anger ﷺ**

*The Prophet ﷺ noticed that some men never attended congregational prayer...*

*They heard the adhan but stayed home without valid excuse...*

*One day, he said firmly:*

**The Prophet ﷺ:** "By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, I have certainly considered ordering wood to be gathered, then commanding the prayer to be called, then ordering a man to lead the people, **then going with men carrying wood to those who do not attend the prayer... and burning their houses upon them!**"

*The Companions shuddered...*

**The Prophet ﷺ continued:** "If one of them knew he would find **a meaty bone or two good sheep hooves**, he would attend 'Isha prayer!"

</div>

**📍 Source:** Sahih Al-Bukhari (644), Sahih Muslim (651)

> ⚠️ **Juridical analysis:** The Prophet ﷺ did not burn the houses because women, children, and excused people were inside. But the threat shows the extreme gravity of abandoning Jama'ah.

---

#### 3️⃣ The Hadith of the Blind Man (Detailed)

> Narrated by **Abu Hurayra** رضي الله عنه: A **blind man** came to the Prophet ﷺ and said: "O Messenger of Allah, I have no guide to lead me to the mosque." He asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ for permission to pray at home, so he gave him permission. When the man turned to leave, he called him back and said:
> **« هَلْ تَسْمَعُ النِّدَاءَ بِالصَّلَاةِ؟ »** He said: Yes. He said: **« فَأَجِبْ »**
> *"Do you hear the call to prayer? — Yes. — **Then respond to it**."*
> — Sahih Muslim (653)

In another version (Ibn Majah 793, authenticated):

> **« لَا أَجِدُ لَكَ رُخْصَةً »** — "I find no dispensation for you"

## 🎓 Scholarly Sayings (أقوال العلماء)

### 🟡 The Maliki School

> **Imam Malik** رحمه الله said in *Al-Mudawwana*:
> *"Congregational prayer is a **Sunna Mu'akkada**. One who abandons it regularly without excuse is blameworthy and deserves reprimand, but his individual prayer remains valid."*

> **Ibn Rushd** (Averroes) wrote in *Bidayat Al-Mujtahid*:
> *"The Malikis say: Sunna Mu'akkada. Regular abandonment without excuse is makruh (blameworthy), and some say it even causes loss of trustworthiness (al-'adalah) for testimony."*

> ⚠️ **Important nuance:** Some great Malikis like **Ibn al-'Arabi al-Maliki** (d. 543H) leaned towards **obligation (wujub)** due to the severity of the hadiths on this matter. This minority but authentic position within the school shows that even among Malikis, Jama'ah is not to be taken lightly.

---

### 🟢 The Hanafi School

> **Abu Hanifa** رحمه الله considered Jama'ah as **Wajib** (near-obligatory), but not Fard 'Ayn.

> In *Al-Hidaya*:
> *"It is a Sunna Mu'akkada close to Wajib. One who abandons it without excuse commits a sin."*

---

### 🔵 The Shafi'i School

> **Imam Ash-Shafi'i** رحمه الله said:
> *"Congregational prayer is **Fard Kifayah** (communal obligation). If some perform it, the obligation falls from others. But the individual who abandons it without excuse does something makruh."*

> **An-Nawawi** رحمه الله in *Al-Majmu'*:
> *"The correct view with us: Sunna Mu'akkada very strongly emphasized, but not Fard 'Ayn."*

---

### 🟣 The Hanbali School

> **Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal** رحمه الله said:
> *"Congregational prayer is **Fard 'Ayn** (individual obligation) for every capable man. One who abandons it without excuse — his prayer is valid but he has committed a sin."*

> **Ibn Qudama** رحمه الله in *Al-Mughni*:
> *"This is the view of Ibn Mas'ud, Abu Hurayra, Ibn 'Umar, and chosen by Ibn al-Qayyim. The hadith of the blind man is explicit."*

---

### ⚖️ Comparative Views — Summary

| School | Status | Sin if abandoned? | Individual prayer valid? |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | Sunna Mu'akkada | Makruh (blameworthy) | ✅ Yes |
| 🟢 **Hanafi** | Sunna Mu'akkada/Wajib | Yes according to some | ✅ Yes |
| 🔵 **Shafi'i** | Fard Kifaya | Makruh | ✅ Yes |
| 🟣 **Hanbali** | **Fard 'Ayn** | **Yes (sin)** | ✅ Yes but with sin |

> 💡 **Practical synthesis:** Even in the most lenient view (Maliki), regular abandonment without excuse is blameworthy. In the strictest view (Hanbali), it's a major sin close to hypocrisy.

## 📚 Detailed Immersive Explanation (الشرح المفصل)

### 🔷 Deep Definition of Jama'ah

**Linguistically:** 
- الجماعة comes from جَمَعَ (to gather)
- It is the union of hearts before bodies
- The opposite of التفرق (dispersion, division)

**In Sharia:** 
When one or more worshippers (ma'mum) follow an imam in prayer, synchronizing their movements and linking their intentions.

**Spiritually:**
It is the effacement of the individual ego in the ocean of the community. You are no longer "me," you are "we."

### 🔷 The Deepened Legal Ruling (الحكم الشرعي)

#### 📌 Detailed Maliki View

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 The Empty Mosque — Medinan Scene**

*In Medina, a man always prayed alone at home...*

*One day, Malik ibn Anas رحمه الله saw him and asked:*

**Malik:** "Why don't you come to the mosque?"

**The Man:** "My prayer at home is valid, isn't it?"

**Malik:** "Valid, yes. But are you satisfied losing 27 times the reward? Are you satisfied resembling the hypocrites whom Allah described: **﴿ وَإِذَا قَامُوا إِلَى الصَّلَاةِ قَامُوا كُسَالَىٰ ﴾** (They rise lazily to prayer)?"

</div>

**Consolidated Maliki Position:**

1. **Status:** Sunna Mu'akkada (strongly recommended)
2. **Praying alone:** Valid, but...
3. **Regular abandonment without excuse:**
   - Makruh Tahrimi (severely blameworthy)
   - Loses trustworthiness ('Adalah) according to some Malikis
   - Sign of potential hypocrisy
4. **Arguments:**
   - The Prophet ﷺ gave permission to the blind man then called him back
   - The threatening hadiths target hypocrites
   - Individual prayer remains mentioned as valid in texts

> 💡 **For Francophone Maliki audience:** Don't take this position as an easy way out. The great Malikis strongly insist on never abandoning Jama'ah.

---

#### 📌 The Hanbali View — The Strictest

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Ibn Mas'ud and the Absent Man**

*Abdullah ibn Mas'ud رضي الله عنه said:*

**Ibn Mas'ud:** "Whoever would like to meet Allah tomorrow as a Muslim, let him preserve these five prayers **where they are called** (i.e., at the mosque). For Allah legislated for your Prophet **the Sunan of guidance**, and these prayers are among them. If you pray in your houses as the one who stays home prays, you will have abandoned the Sunnah of your Prophet. And if you abandon the Sunnah of your Prophet, you will go astray."

**He continued:** "There was no one who absented himself from prayer except a **hypocrite known for his hypocrisy**. One would see a sick man being supported by two men until he was placed in the row."

</div>

**📍 Source:** Sahih Muslim (654)

**Hanbali Arguments for Fard 'Ayn:**

1. ✅ Hadith of the blind man: **« لَا أَجِدُ لَكَ رُخْصَةً »**
2. ✅ Threat to burn houses
3. ✅ Ibn Mas'ud: only hypocrites were absent
4. ✅ Allah commands it even in wartime (Salat al-Khawf)
5. ✅ The Prophet ﷺ never abandoned it, even when sick

*He would say firmly:*

**The Prophet ﷺ:** **« لَتُسَوُّنَّ صُفُوفَكُمْ أَوْ لَيُخَالِفَنَّ اللهُ بَيْنَ وُجُوهِكُمْ »**

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 The Warning of Transformation**

*The Prophet ﷺ saw a man raise his head before the imam...*

*He said severely:*

**The Prophet ﷺ:** **« أَمَا يَخْشَى أَحَدُكُمْ — أَوْ لَا يَخْشَى أَحَدُكُمْ — إِذَا رَفَعَ رَأْسَهُ قَبْلَ الْإِمَامِ أَنْ يَجْعَلَ اللهُ رَأْسَهُ رَأْسَ حِمَارٍ، أَوْ يَجْعَلَ اللهُ صُورَتَهُ صُورَةَ حِمَارٍ »**

#### 🎯 How to Join a Prayer in Progress

**Detailed steps:**

1. **Enter mosque calmly**: « إِذَا أُقِيمَتِ الصَّلَاةُ فَلَا تَأْتُوهَا تَسْعَوْنَ وَأْتُوهَا تَمْشُونَ » — "Don't rush to the prayer, come calmly" (Bukhari 636)

2. **Make Takbirat al-Ihram standing**: Even if the imam is in prostration

3. **Join the imam in his position**: If in ruku', go down to ruku'

4. **What counts as a caught rak'a**: If you join the imam before he rises from ruku'

5. **After imam's salam**: Remain seated or stand to make up

---

#### 🧮 Calculation of Made-Up Rak'at

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Practical Case — Maghrib**

| **Before 1st ruku'** | 3 rak'at | Nothing | You did complete Maghrib |
| **In 1st ruku'** | 3 rak'at | Nothing | Rak'a counted |
| **After 1st ruku'** | 2 rak'at | 1 rak'a | Stand after salam, do 1 |

#### 4️⃣ Online Prayer (Zoom/Skype) — COVID Question

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Opinion of Major Fatwa Councils (2020-2021)**

**Situation:** Mosques closed, can we follow the imam via screen?

**Near-unanimous answer:** ❌ **NO**

**Reasons:**
1. No real physical connection (al-ittissal al-haqiqi)
2. The Ma'mum must see the imam or the rows
3. Delay in transmission (even 1 second)
4. No consensus of Companions on virtual prayer

**Alternative:** Pray alone at home with intention of Jama'ah

</div>
