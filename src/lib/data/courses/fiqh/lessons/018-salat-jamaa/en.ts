## 📖 Congregational Prayer (Salat Al-Jama'a)

All praise be to Allah who made congregational prayer a pillar of Muslim communal life. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ who never abandoned it. Congregational prayer is one of the most apparent rites of Islam and a cause for multiplied rewards.

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Congregational prayer is superior to individual prayer by twenty-seven degrees"** — Al-Bukhari (645), Muslim (650)

## 🔍 1. The Legal Ruling (الحكم الشرعي)

### ⚠️ The Opinions of the 4 Schools

| School | Ruling | Main Evidence |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | **Sunna Mu'akkada** (strongly recommended) | The Prophet's constant practice without explicit obligation |
| 🟢 Hanafi | Sunna Mu'akkada (Wajib according to some) | Same |
| 🔵 Shafi'i | Fard Kifaya (communal obligation) | To manifest the rites of Islam |
| 🟣 Hanbali | Fard 'Ayn (individual obligation) | Hadith of the blind man and threat to burn houses |

### 📌 Detail of the Maliki Opinion

According to the Maliki school, congregational prayer for the five daily prayers is a **Sunna Mu'akkada** (strongly recommended prophetic tradition). Abandoning it without valid excuse is blameworthy (makruh) but does not constitute a major sin.

**Maliki Arguments:**
- The Prophet ﷺ never explicitly made it obligatory
- The threatening hadiths were directed at hypocrites who abandoned the mosque
- Individual prayer remains valid by consensus

> 💡 **For Malikis:** The jama'a is strongly recommended and regular abandonment without excuse is blameworthy, but individual prayer remains valid.

### 📌 Arguments of Other Schools

**The Hanbalis** base their opinion on:
- The verse: **"And bow with those who bow"** (Al-Baqara: 43)
- The hadith of the blind man who asked for an exemption, the Prophet ﷺ said: **"I find no exemption for you"** — Muslim (653)
- The threat: **"I have certainly considered ordering the prayer to be established, then commanding a man to lead the people in prayer, then going with men carrying bundles of firewood to people who do not attend the prayer and burning their houses down"** — Al-Bukhari (644), Muslim (651)

## 🔷 2. Virtues of Congregational Prayer (فضائل صلاة الجماعة)

### 🌟 Multiplication of Rewards

| Virtue | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **27 degrees of superiority** | "Congregational prayer is superior by 27 degrees" — Al-Bukhari (645) |
| **25 degrees in another version** | "...by 25 degrees" — Al-Bukhari (619) |
| **Walking to the mosque = rewards** | Each step raises a degree and erases a sin — Muslim (649) |
| **Waiting for prayer = prayer** | "You are in prayer as long as you await the prayer" — Al-Bukhari (647) |
| **Angels make du'a for him** | "The angels pray upon one of you as long as he remains in his place of prayer" — Al-Bukhari (445) |

### 📌 Important Hadith

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"A man's prayer in congregation equals twenty-five or twenty-seven times his prayer in his house or market. That is because when he performs ablution well, then goes out to the mosque with no other purpose than prayer, each step he takes raises him a degree and erases a sin"** — Al-Bukhari (647)
