## 📚 Detailed Explanation (الشرح المفصل)

### 🔷 Definition of Congregational Prayer

**Linguistically:** Jama'a refers to gathering and union of people.

**In Sharia:** It is when one or more worshippers (ma'mum) follow an imam in prayer, linking their actions to his.

### 🔷 Legal Ruling (الحكم الشرعي)

### 📌 Maliki School Detail

According to the Maliki school, congregational prayer for the five daily prayers is a **Sunna Mu'akkada** (strongly emphasized prophetic tradition). Abandoning it without valid excuse is blameworthy (makruh) but not a major sin.

**Maliki Arguments:**
- The Prophet ﷺ never explicitly made it obligatory
- The threatening hadiths were directed at hypocrites
- Individual prayer remains valid by consensus

> 💡 **For Malikis:** Congregational prayer is strongly recommended and regular abandonment without excuse is blameworthy, but individual prayer remains valid.
