## 📖 Obligatory Actions of Prayer and the Prostration of Forgetfulness

All praise be to Allah who perfected the religion for us. May peace and blessings be upon the one who taught the Ummah the rulings of prayer in detail. After learning the pillars, we now move to the **obligatory actions (wajibat)** which are compensated by the prostration of forgetfulness if left out of negligence, and which invalidate the prayer if deliberately omitted.

> Imam Ahmad said: *"The obligations are below the pillars, but it is not befitting for a Muslim to neglect them."*

## 📜 Scene: Forgetting the Tashahhud

<div class="scene-box">

*At the neighborhood mosque, Ahmed finishes his second rak'a...*

*Instead of sitting for the first tashahhud, he stands up directly for the third rak'a.*

**The imam** (next to him): *[clearing his throat slightly]* "Subhan'Allah..."

**Ahmed**: *[realizing his mistake mid-way]* "Oh no, I forgot the tashahhud! Should I go back down?"

*He continues standing since he's closer to the standing position...*

*At the end of the prayer, before the salam...*

**Ahmed**: *[performs two additional prostrations]*

**A brother after the prayer**: "Why did you do those two extra prostrations?"

**Ahmed**: "It's the prostration of forgetfulness. I forgot the first tashahhud, and since I was closer to the standing position when I realized, I continued and compensated with two prostrations before the salam, just as the Prophet ﷺ did."

**📍 Reference:** Hadith of Abdullah ibn Buhayna — Al-Bukhari (829)

## 📜 Scene: The Difference Between Pillar and Obligation

<div class="scene-box">

*A father teaches his son the nuances of fiqh...*

**Yusuf** (12 years old): "Dad, if I forget something in my prayer, is it still valid?"

**Father**: "It depends on what you forget. Imagine the prayer like a house."

**Yusuf**: "A house?"

**Father**: "Yes. The **pillars** are like the walls and roof — without them, the house collapses. You can't compensate for them otherwise."

**Yusuf**: "And the obligations?"

**Father**: "The **obligations** are like the windows and doors. The house stands without them, but it's not complete. If you forget them, you can compensate with the prostration of forgetfulness."

**Yusuf**: "And the sunnas?"

**Father**: "Those are the decorations and furniture. Your house is valid without them, but it's much more beautiful with them!"

## 🔍 The Difference Between a Pillar and an Obligation

- **Pillar (Rukn):** An essential part of the prayer; the act is not valid without it, and it cannot be compensated by the prostration of forgetfulness.
- **Obligation (Wajib):** What is commanded in prayer; its forgetful omission is compensated by the prostration of forgetfulness, but its deliberate omission invalidates the prayer according to the correct opinion.
- **Sunnah:** What the one who does it is rewarded for and the one who leaves it is not punished, but it increases reward and khushu' (humility).

## 📚 The Eight Obligations in Prayer (According to the Relied-Upon View Among Hanbalis)

| No. | Obligation | Authentic Proof | Practical Notes |
|-----|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **All takbirs other than the opening takbir** | Hadith of Wa'il ibn Hujr: "The Prophet ﷺ, when he stood for prayer, would say: Allahu Akbar..." — Abu Dawud (734) | Includes transitions between pillars |
| 2 | **Saying: Sami'a Allahu liman hamidah** for the imam and one praying alone | Hadith of Abu Hurayra on the description of prayer — Al-Bukhari (789) | The follower says: Rabbana wa laka al-hamd |
| 3 | **Saying: Rabbana wa laka al-hamd** for everyone | Agreed upon — Al-Bukhari (795) | Additional reported phrases are permissible |
| 4 | **Tasbih of bowing** (once) | "As for bowing, glorify the Lord in it" — Muslim (479) | Minimum: Subhana rabbi al-'azim |
| 5 | **Tasbih of prostration** (once) | "As for prostration, strive in supplication" — Muslim (479) and the meaning of tasbih is established in multiple hadiths | Minimum: Subhana rabbi al-a'la |
| 6 | **Saying: Rabbi ghfir li** between the two prostrations | Hadith of Hudhayfa: "And he would say between the two prostrations: Rabbi ghfir li, Rabbi ghfir li" — Abu Dawud (874) | Additional reported phrases like: warhamni are permissible |
| 7 | **The first tashahhud** | Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "We used to say before the tashahhud was obligated upon us..." — Muslim (402) | Its forgetful omission is compensated by the prostration of forgetfulness |
| 8 | **Sitting for the first tashahhud** | It follows from the tashahhud itself, so it takes its ruling | Sit with slight tranquility |

> **Note:** Some schools differ in number and details, but this list is chosen for what suits youth while adhering to evidence.

## 🔷 The Prostration of Forgetfulness in Brief

1. **When is it legislated?** Upon omitting an obligation, adding a pillar out of forgetfulness, or doubting the number of rak'at.
2. **How to perform it?** Two prostrations, with the usual prostration dhikr.
3. **Its placement:**
   - After the salam: when there is an addition in prayer or doubt where addition predominates.
   - Before the salam: when an obligation is omitted or the doubt is equal.
4. **The proof:** Hadith of Abdullah ibn Buhayna about the Prophet's ﷺ prostration before salam when omitting the first tashahhud — Al-Bukhari (829), and hadith of Dhu al-Yadayn about prostration after salam — Muslim (573).
