## 📖 Obligatory Actions of Prayer and the Prostration of Forgetfulness

All praise be to Allah who perfected the religion for us. May peace and blessings be upon the one who taught the Ummah the rulings of prayer in detail. After learning the pillars, we now move to the **obligatory actions (wajibat)** which are compensated by the prostration of forgetfulness if left out of negligence, and which invalidate the prayer if deliberately omitted.

> Imam Ahmad said: *"The obligations are below the pillars, but it is not befitting for a Muslim to neglect them."*

## 🔍 The Difference Between a Pillar and an Obligation

- **Pillar (Rukn):** An essential part of the prayer; the act is not valid without it, and it cannot be compensated by the prostration of forgetfulness.
- **Obligation (Wajib):** What is commanded in prayer; its forgetful omission is compensated by the prostration of forgetfulness, but its deliberate omission invalidates the prayer according to the correct opinion.
- **Sunnah:** What the one who does it is rewarded for and the one who leaves it is not punished, but it increases reward and khushu' (humility).

## 📚 The Eight Obligations in Prayer (According to the Relied-Upon View Among Hanbalis)

| No. | Obligation | Authentic Proof | Practical Notes |
|-----|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **All takbirs other than the opening takbir** | Hadith of Wa'il ibn Hujr: "The Prophet ﷺ, when he stood for prayer, would say: Allahu Akbar..." — Abu Dawud (734) | Includes transitions between pillars |
| 2 | **Saying: Sami'a Allahu liman hamidah** for the imam and one praying alone | Hadith of Abu Hurayra on the description of prayer — Al-Bukhari (789) | The follower says: Rabbana wa laka al-hamd |
| 3 | **Saying: Rabbana wa laka al-hamd** for everyone | Agreed upon — Al-Bukhari (795) | Additional reported phrases are permissible |
| 4 | **Tasbih of bowing** (once) | "As for bowing, glorify the Lord in it" — Muslim (479) | Minimum: Subhana rabbi al-'azim |
| 5 | **Tasbih of prostration** (once) | "As for prostration, strive in supplication" — Muslim (479) and the meaning of tasbih is established in multiple hadiths | Minimum: Subhana rabbi al-a'la |
| 6 | **Saying: Rabbi ghfir li** between the two prostrations | Hadith of Hudhayfa: "And he would say between the two prostrations: Rabbi ghfir li, Rabbi ghfir li" — Abu Dawud (874) | Additional reported phrases like: warhamni are permissible |
| 7 | **The first tashahhud** | Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "We used to say before the tashahhud was obligated upon us..." — Muslim (402) | Its forgetful omission is compensated by the prostration of forgetfulness |
| 8 | **Sitting for the first tashahhud** | It follows from the tashahhud itself, so it takes its ruling | Sit with slight tranquility |

> **Note:** Some schools differ in number and details, but this list is chosen for what suits youth while adhering to evidence.

## 🔷 The Prostration of Forgetfulness in Brief

1. **When is it legislated?** Upon omitting an obligation, adding a pillar out of forgetfulness, or doubting the number of rak'at.
2. **How to perform it?** Two prostrations, with the usual prostration dhikr.
3. **Its placement:**
   - After the salam: when there is an addition in prayer or doubt where addition predominates.
   - Before the salam: when an obligation is omitted or the doubt is equal.
4. **The proof:** Hadith of Abdullah ibn Buhayna about the Prophet's ﷺ prostration before salam when omitting the first tashahhud — Al-Bukhari (829), and hadith of Dhu al-Yadayn about prostration after salam — Muslim (573).

## 🎓 Comparison of Schools on Obligations

### 📌 Divergence on the Number of Obligations

| School | Number of Obligations | Main Obligations According to Them |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | Called **emphasized sunan** | Takbirs, tasmi' and tahmid, tasbih, first tashahhud |
| 🟢 **Hanafi** | 14 obligations | Recitation of Al-Fatiha, specifying the obligatory prayer, moderation, the last sitting for the duration of tashahhud |
| 🔵 **Shafi'i** | No distinction between pillar and obligation | Everything other than pillars is sunnah for them |
| 🟣 **Hanbali** | 8 obligations | As mentioned in the table above |

> 📌 **Note:** Malikis use the term **"emphasized sunnah"** instead of **"obligation"**, but the practical application is similar.

### 📌 Placement of Prostration of Forgetfulness According to Schools

| School | Placement of Prostration | Detail |
|--------|------------------------|--------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | Before salam for omission, after for addition | If both combine, before salam takes priority |
| 🟢 **Hanafi** | After salam in all cases | Make salam then prostrate twice then make salam |
| 🔵 **Shafi'i** | Before salam in all cases | Preferable to do it before salam in all situations |
| 🟣 **Hanbali** | Varies according to cause | Before salam for omission, after for addition or doubt |

> 📌 **Preferred view:** The view of Malikis and Hanbalis is most conforming to the hadiths: prostrate before salam for omission, and after for addition.

### 📌 Ruling on Deliberately Omitting an Obligation

| School | Ruling |
|--------|--------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | Prayer is not invalid, but he is sinful and must prostrate for forgetfulness |
| 🟢 **Hanafi** | Prayer is invalid if obligation is omitted deliberately |
| 🔵 **Shafi'i** | No obligations for them other than pillars, so no invalidation |
| 🟣 **Hanbali** | Prayer is invalid if obligation is omitted deliberately according to the recognized view |

### 📌 Prostration of Forgetfulness for the Follower

| School | Ruling |
|--------|--------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | Imam bears the follower's forgetfulness except for omission that imam cannot bear |
| 🟢 **Hanafi** | No prostration for follower, imam bears his forgetfulness |
| 🔵 **Shafi'i** | Follower follows his imam, prostrates with him even if he didn't forget |
| 🟣 **Hanbali** | Imam bears the follower's forgetfulness in most cases |

> 📌 **Consensus:** Scholars agree that the follower follows his imam in the prostration of forgetfulness.

3. **Group Review:** Discuss with your peers the differences between obligation and sunnah at each position.
