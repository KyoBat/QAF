## 📖 Prayer of the Sick (Salat Al-Marid)

All praise be to Allah who did not burden His servants with what they cannot bear. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ who taught us the facilitations for the sick. Illness never exempts one from prayer as long as the mind is present.

> Allah تعالى says: **"Fear Allah as much as you are able"** — At-Taghabun: 16

**🎭 The Scene of 'Imran ibn Husayn — The Foundation for Prayer of the Sick**

*He could not sit, let alone stand...*

*He went to ask the Prophet ﷺ how to pray:*

**The Prophet ﷺ:** "Pray standing, if you cannot then sitting, if you cannot then on your side"

</div>

**📍 Narrator:** 'Imran ibn Husayn رضي الله عنه — Al-Bukhari (1117)

## 🔍 1. Fundamental Principle

### 📌 Prayer never falls away

| Principle | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **As long as the mind is present** | The conscious sick person must pray |
| **According to ability** | Do what you can, leave what you cannot |
| **No make-up if unconscious** | Insanity and prolonged fainting exempt |

> 💡 **Golden Rule:** Prayer is the last pillar to fall. Even the dying must pray by signs if able.
