### 🩺 Case 4: Chronic Illness — When Does It Become a Permanent Excuse?

> **Situation:** Fatima has suffered from severe arthritis for years. Some days she can stand with difficulty, other days it's impossible. She wonders if she can always pray sitting.

**❓ When does an illness become a permanent excuse allowing one to always pray sitting?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the answer</summary>

**Evaluation criteria:**

| Criterion | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Consistency of inability** | The excuse applies to moments of actual inability |
| **Medical opinion** | Doctor confirms risk or impossibility |
| **Excessive hardship** | Unbearable pain or risk of worsening |
| **Variable capacity** | Each prayer is evaluated independently |

**Practical rule:**

1. **Days when she can stand:** She must pray standing
2. **Days when it's impossible/very painful:** She prays sitting
3. **No arbitrary choice:** We don't choose for comfort but for actual capacity

**Chronic illness cases:**
- If doctor certifies standing worsens the condition → pray sitting permanently
- If variable → evaluate at each prayer
- The threshold = excessive hardship (المشقة الفادحة), not mere discomfort

> 💡 **Rule:** The excuse is linked to the capacity of the moment. A chronic illness is not a general permission but is evaluated prayer by prayer, unless the doctor confirms a permanent risk.

### 🦴 Case 5: Praying with a Cast or Broken Limb

> **Situation:** Yusuf broke his leg and has a cast up to his thigh. He can walk with crutches but cannot prostrate normally.

**❓ How should he pray with this cast?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the answer</summary>

**Movement analysis:**

| Movement | Ability | Adaptation |
|----------|---------|------------|
| **Standing** | ✅ Possible with crutches or support | Pray standing with light support |
| **Rukū'** | ✅ Possible | Bow normally |
| **Sujūd** | ⚠️ Difficult | See options below |
| **Sitting** | ⚠️ Difficult | Cast leg extended |

**Sujūd options:**

1. **If he can place his forehead on the ground** (even with leg extended) → Do so
2. **If he cannot at all:** Pray sitting with gestures
3. **Use a support:** Place forehead on an elevated cushion

**For wudu:**
- Wipe over the cast (المسح على الجبيرة)
- No need to get water underneath
- Valid as long as the cast is in place

> 💡 **Rule:** The cast allows wiping over it for wudu, and prayer adapts according to what the person can do. Partial inability does not exempt from what remains possible.
