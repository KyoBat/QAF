export const content = `# Zakat Beneficiaries (مصارف الزكاة)

Allah ﷻ has precisely defined the eight categories of Zakat beneficiaries in the Quran. This distribution is an act of worship that cannot be altered.

> Allah ﷻ says: **"إِنَّمَا الصَّدَقَاتُ لِلْفُقَرَاءِ وَالْمَسَاكِينِ وَالْعَامِلِينَ عَلَيْهَا وَالْمُؤَلَّفَةِ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَفِي الرِّقَابِ وَالْغَارِمِينَ وَفِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَابْنِ السَّبِيلِ ۖ فَرِيضَةً مِّنَ اللَّهِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ"**
>
> *"Zakah expenditures are only for the poor, the needy, those employed to collect [zakah], for bringing hearts together, for freeing captives, for those in debt, for the cause of Allah, and for the stranded traveler - an obligation from Allah. And Allah is Knowing and Wise."* — Surah At-Tawba (9:60)
