# Al-Ghusl (Major Ablution)

## 1. Definition of Ghusl

**Linguistically:** It means washing the entire body with water.
**Islamically (Shari'ah):** It is the washing of the entire body with pure water, with a specific intention (Niyyah) to remove major ritual impurity (Hadath Akbar).

Allah (SWT) says:
> "And if you are in a state of janabah, then purify yourselves."
> (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:6)

## 2. When is Ghusl Obligatory? (Causes of Ghusl)

Ghusl becomes obligatory (Wajib) in the following situations:

1.  **Janabah (Major Ritual Impurity):**
    *   **Emission of Maniy (semen):** With pleasure, whether awake or asleep (wet dream).
        *   *Hadith:* The Prophet ﷺ said: "Water (Ghusl) is only from water (semen)." (Muslim)
    *   **Sexual Intercourse:** Mere penetration requires Ghusl, even if no emission occurs.
        *   *Hadith:* The Prophet ﷺ said: "If he sits between her four parts and strives (has intercourse), then Ghusl is obligatory." (Bukhari & Muslim)

2.  **End of Menstruation (Hayd) and Postpartum Bleeding (Nifas):**
    *   A woman must perform Ghusl once the bleeding stops to resume prayer and fasting.
    *   *Hadith:* The Prophet ﷺ said to Fatimah bint Abi Hubaysh: "When the menstruation comes, leave the prayer, and when it goes, wash the blood from yourself and pray." (Bukhari)

3.  **Death:**
    *   When a Muslim dies, it is obligatory for the community to wash the body (except for a martyr who dies in battle).

4.  **Entering Islam:**
    *   It is obligatory (or highly recommended according to some) for a new convert to perform Ghusl.
    *   *Hadith:* The Prophet ﷺ ordered Qais bin Asim to perform Ghusl with water and Sidr (lote tree leaves) when he accepted Islam.

## 3. Pillars (Faraid) of Ghusl

For the Ghusl to be valid, two main conditions must be met:

1.  **Intention (Niyyah):** To intend purification from major impurity. The place of intention is the heart.
2.  **Generalizing Water over the Entire Body:** Water must reach every part of the body, including the scalp, hair roots, and hidden areas.
    *   *Note:* Many scholars (like Hanafis and Hanbalis) consider rinsing the mouth (Madmadah) and nose (Istinshaq) as obligatory parts of Ghusl.

## 4. Sunan of Ghusl (Recommended Acts)

1.  Saying "Bismillah" (In the name of Allah).
2.  Washing the hands three times at the beginning.
3.  Washing the private parts and removing any impurity.
4.  Performing Wudu (ablution) completely before washing the body.
5.  Pouring water over the head three times, ensuring it reaches the roots.
6.  Starting with the right side of the body, then the left.
7.  Rubbing the body (Dalk) to ensure water reaches everywhere.
8.  Continuity (Muwalat) - washing parts in succession.

## 5. Description of the Prophet's ﷺ Ghusl (Complete Method)

Based on the Hadith of Aisha (RA) and Maimunah (RA), the complete method is:

1.  **Intention:** Intend to remove the major impurity.
2.  **Bismillah:** Say "Bismillah".
3.  **Wash Hands:** Wash hands three times.
4.  **Wash Private Parts:** Wash the private parts with the left hand to remove any filth.
5.  **Perform Wudu:** Perform a complete Wudu (like for prayer). You may delay washing the feet until the end if the floor is muddy.
6.  **Wash Head:** Pour water over the head three times, rubbing the hair to ensure water reaches the roots.
7.  **Wash Body:** Pour water over the rest of the body, starting with the **right side**, then the **left side**. Ensure water reaches armpits, ears, navel, and between toes.
8.  **Wash Feet:** If not done during Wudu, wash the feet now.

## 6. Types of Ghusl: Sufficient vs. Complete

There are two acceptable ways to perform Ghusl:

### A. Sufficient Ghusl (Mujzi')
This fulfills the obligation and makes a person pure, but misses the rewards of the Sunnah acts.
*   **Method:** Intention + Washing the entire body (including mouth and nose).
*   **Example:** Plunging into a pool or standing under a shower with the intention of Ghusl, ensuring water touches every part of the body.

### B. Complete Ghusl (Kamil)
This follows the Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ exactly as described above.
*   **Method:** Intention + Washing hands + Private parts + Wudu + Washing head + Washing entire body (Right then Left).

**Note:** Both methods are valid for purification, but the Complete Ghusl is more rewarding.
