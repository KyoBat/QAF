## 📖 The Two Eid Prayers (Salat Al-Eidayn)

All praise be to Allah who has guided us, and we would not have been guided without His guidance. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. Allah has blessed this nation with two blessed festivals: Eid Al-Fitr after Ramadan, and Eid Al-Adha on the 10th of Dhu Al-Hijjah.

> The Prophet ﷺ arrived in Medina and found the people with two days of celebration. He said: **"Allah has replaced these two days with two better ones: the day of Al-Adha and the day of Al-Fitr"** — Abu Dawud (1134)
