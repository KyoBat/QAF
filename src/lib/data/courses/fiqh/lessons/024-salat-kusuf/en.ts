## The Eclipse Prayer (Salat Al-Kusuf)

All praise be to Allah who shows us His signs in the heavens and on earth. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. Solar and lunar eclipses are signs of Allah by which He frightens His servants.

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"The sun and moon are two signs among the signs of Allah. They do not eclipse for the death or life of anyone. When you see that, invoke Allah, make takbir, pray and give in charity"** — Al-Bukhari (1044)
