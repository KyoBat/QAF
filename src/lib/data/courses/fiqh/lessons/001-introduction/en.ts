## ✨ Welcome to this Noble Science

All praise is due to Allah who taught by the pen, who taught mankind what they knew not. May peace and blessings be upon the teacher of humanity and guide of the Ummah, our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.

Dear brother, dear sister in Islam, welcome to the first step of an extraordinary journey — the journey of learning **Islamic Fiqh**, the science that illuminates every moment of your life, from your prayer to your dealings, from your purification to your worship.

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Whoever Allah wants good for, He grants him understanding of the religion"**
> — Agreed upon (Bukhari & Muslim)

This blessed hadith reveals the high status of Fiqh with Allah. When Allah wants good for someone, He opens for them the door of understanding His religion!

## 📖 What is Fiqh?

### Linguistic Definition
**Al-Fiqh** (الفقه) in Arabic means: **deep and precise understanding**, not mere superficial knowledge.

Allah تعالى says:
> ﴾ What is wrong with these people that they can hardly **understand** (يَفْقَهُونَ) any word? ﴿
> — Surah An-Nisa: 78

### Technical Definition
Fiqh in Islamic terminology is:

> **The science of practical Sharia rulings derived from their detailed evidences**

Let's break down this definition:
- **Science**: certain or highly probable knowledge
- **Sharia rulings**: divine commands and prohibitions
- **Practical**: relating to actions of legally responsible people (not beliefs)
- **From detailed evidences**: from the Quran, Sunnah, consensus, and analogy

## 🌟 Why Learn Fiqh?

### 1. It's an obligation upon every Muslim
Allah تعالى says:
> ﴾ And it is not proper for the believers to go out all together. Of every group, let a party go forth to **gain understanding in the religion** and warn their people when they return ﴿
> — Surah At-Tawba: 122

### 2. To worship Allah with knowledge
Worship without knowledge may be invalid or incomplete. Fiqh teaches you how to pray as the Prophet ﷺ prayed, how to fast, give Zakat, and perform Hajj.

### 3. To distinguish the lawful from the unlawful
Allah تعالى says:
> ﴾ Allah has made trade lawful and has forbidden usury ﴿
> — Surah Al-Baqara: 275
