## Introduction

Purification is one of the most important topics in Islamic jurisprudence. It is the key to prayer and a condition for its validity. The Prophet ﷺ said: **"The key to prayer is purification."** (Narrated by Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi).

Allah says: ﴿Indeed, Allah loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves.﴾ [Al-Baqarah: 222].

## Definition of Tahara

**Linguistically:** Cleanliness and freedom from physical and spiritual impurities.
**Legally:** Removing ritual impurity (Hadath) and physical impurity (Khabath/Najasah).

- **Hadath (Ritual Impurity):** A state of the body that prevents prayer (minor hadath is removed by Wudu, major hadath by Ghusl).
- **Khabath (Physical Impurity/Najasah):** A filthy substance that must be removed according to Sharia.

## Categories of Water

### Overview

| Type of Water | Definition | Purification Status | Drinking Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Tahur (Pure & Purifying) | Remains in its original state | Purifies | Permissible |
| Tahir (Pure only) | Changed by a pure substance | Does not purify | Permissible |
| Najis (Impure) | Changed by an impurity | Does not purify | Forbidden |

## Category 1: Tahur Water (Pure & Purifying)

### Definition
Water that remains in its original natural state - its taste, color, and smell have not been altered by anything that would change its nature.

### Ruling
- **Pure in itself:** Permissible to drink and use.
- **Purifying for others:** Valid for Wudu and Ghusl.

### Evidence
Allah says: ﴿And We have sent down from the sky purifying water.﴾ [Al-Furqan: 48].

The Prophet ﷺ said about seawater: **"Its water is purifying, and its dead (fish) are lawful."** (Narrated by Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi, authenticated).

### Examples of Tahur Water

1. **Rainwater:** ﴿And He sent down upon you from the sky, rain by which to purify you.﴾ [Al-Anfal: 11].
2. **Seawater:** As in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah above.
3. **River and spring water:** In their natural state.
4. **Well water:** Such as Zamzam water.
5. **Melted snow and hail:** The Prophet ﷺ said: **"O Allah, wash away my sins with water, snow, and hail."** (Agreed upon).

## Category 2: Tahir Water (Pure but Not Purifying)

### Definition
Water whose taste, color, or smell has changed due to a pure substance mixing with it.

### Ruling
- **Pure in itself:** Permissible to drink.
- **Not purifying:** Wudu and Ghusl are not valid with it (according to the majority of scholars).

### Examples

1. Water changed by tea or coffee.
2. Water significantly changed by soap.
3. Rose water extracted from flowers.
4. Broth and fruit juices.

### Important Note
If water changes due to something pure that cannot normally be separated from it (like algae, fallen leaves, or dust), it remains **Tahur** according to the correct opinion, because such change is unintentional and unavoidable.

## Category 3: Najis Water (Impure)

### Definition
Water whose taste, color, or smell has changed due to an impurity falling into it.

### Ruling
- **Impure:** Not permissible to drink or use.
- **Not purifying:** Wudu and Ghusl are not valid with it.

### Evidence
The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Water is pure and nothing makes it impure."** (Narrated by Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi).

**Understanding the Hadith:** Water does not become impure merely by impurity falling into it; it only becomes impure **if it changes** because of it.

### Scenarios of Impurity Falling into Water

| Scenario | Ruling |
| :--- | :--- |
| Large amount of water + impurity that didn't change it | **Tahur** (valid for purification) |
| Small amount of water + impurity that didn't change it | **Tahur** according to the correct opinion |
| Any water + impurity that changed it | **Najis** (not valid for purification) |

### How to Purify Impure Water?

1. **Addition:** By adding a large amount of pure water until the change disappears.
2. **Natural removal:** If the change disappears over time or due to sun and wind.
3. **Draining:** By draining the changed water until it returns to its original state.

## Important Issues Regarding Water

### 1. Used Water (Al-Ma' Al-Musta'mal)
Water that has separated from the limbs after Wudu or Ghusl.
- **Correct opinion:** It is **Tahur** and can be used again, though it's better to avoid it.

### 2. Sun-heated Water
Water heated by the sun's heat.
- **Ruling:** **Tahur** and valid for purification, though some scholars disliked it fearing harm to the skin.

### 3. Fire-heated Water
- **Ruling:** **Tahur** without any dislike.

### 4. Zamzam Water
- **Ruling:** **Tahur** - Wudu and Ghusl are valid with it, and it is the best of all waters.
- However, using it for Istinja (cleaning after relieving oneself) is disliked out of respect for it.

## Other Purification Tools

### 1. Earth/Dust (As-Sa'id At-Tayyib)
Used for **Tayammum** when water is unavailable or its use is harmful.
﴿Then seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and hands.﴾ [An-Nisa: 43].

### 2. Stones (Istijmar)
Used for **Istinja** to remove what exits from the private parts.
- Must be pure, and at least three stones (or wipes) until cleanliness is achieved.

### 3. Tanning (Dibagha)
Purifies the skins of dead animals (except pig and dog according to the correct opinion).
The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Any skin that is tanned has become pure."** (Narrated by Muslim).
