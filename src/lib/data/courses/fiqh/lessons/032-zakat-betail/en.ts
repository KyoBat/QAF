Livestock (الأنعام) includes camels, cattle, and sheep/goats. It is one of the first types of wealth subject to Zakat in Islam.

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"There is no owner of camels, cattle, or sheep who does not pay their Zakat, except that they will come on the Day of Resurrection larger and fatter than they were, trampling him with their hooves and goring him with their horns..."** — Al-Bukhari (1460) and Muslim (987)
