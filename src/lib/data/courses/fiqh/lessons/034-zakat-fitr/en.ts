Zakat Al-Fitr (صدقة الفطر) is an obligatory charity at the end of Ramadan. It purifies the fasting person and provides food for the poor on Eid day.

> Ibn 'Umar رضي الله عنهما reported: **"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ prescribed Zakat Al-Fitr: a sa' of dates or a sa' of barley, upon the slave and the free, the male and the female, the young and the old among the Muslims. And he ordered it to be given before the people go out for the (Eid) prayer."** — Al-Bukhari (1503) and Muslim (984)
