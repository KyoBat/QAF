export const content = `# Conditions of Zakat Obligation (شروط وجوب الزكاة)

Before paying Zakat, a Muslim must verify that they meet the conditions that make it obligatory. These conditions ensure that the obligation only falls on those who truly have the capacity.

> Allah تعالى says: **"Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity"** — Al-Baqarah: 286

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"There is no Zakat on wealth until a year has passed"** — At-Tirmidhi (631), Ibn Majah (1792)

## 1. Overview of Conditions

### 📋 Conditions According to Malikis

| # | Condition | Arabic | Applies to |
|---|-----------|--------|------------|
| 1 | **Islam** | الإسلام | All wealth |
| 2 | **Freedom** | الحرية | All wealth (historical) |
| 3 | **Complete Ownership** | الملك التام | All wealth |
| 4 | **Reaching Nisab** | بلوغ النصاب | All wealth |
| 5 | **Passage of Hawl** | حولان الحول | Gold, silver, trade, livestock |
| 6 | **Growth Capacity** | النماء | All wealth |
| 7 | **Absence of Debt** | عدم الدين | ⚠️ Divergence |

---

## 2. First Condition: Islam (الإسلام)

### 📌 Principle

Zakat is only obligatory upon a **Muslim**. A non-Muslim is not liable for Zakat.

| Status | Zakat Obligatory? |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Muslim** | ✅ Yes |
| **Non-Muslim** | ❌ No |
| **Apostate** | ⚠️ Wealth is suspended |

### 📌 Proof

> The Prophet ﷺ said to Mu'adh: **"You are going to a people of the Book. First invite them to testify that there is no god but Allah... then inform them that Allah has enjoined Zakat upon them..."** — Al-Bukhari (1395)

---

## 3. Second Condition: Freedom (الحرية)

### 📌 Historical Principle

Historically, slaves did not own their wealth, so Zakat was not obligatory upon them. This condition has no practical application today.

---

## 4. Third Condition: Complete Ownership (الملك التام)

### 📌 Definition

**Milk At-Tam** (الملك التام) means the owner has full power of disposition over the property: using it, selling it, giving it away, etc.

### 📋 What Constitutes Complete Ownership

| Situation | Complete Ownership? | Zakat? |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| **Money in bank** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Due |
| **Salary received** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Due (after Hawl) |
| **Undivided inheritance** | ✅ Yes, from death | ✅ Due on one's share |
| **Promised dowry not received** | ❌ No | ❌ Not due |
| **Doubtful debt** | ⚠️ Partial | ⚠️ Divergence |
| **Property in dispute** | ❌ No | ❌ Not due |
| **Stolen/lost property** | ❌ No | ❌ Not due |

### ⚠️ Case of Debts Owed to You

| Type of Debt | 🟡 Maliki |
|--------------|-----------|
| **Secure debt (from solvent person)** | Zakat due **upon recovery**, for one year only |
| **Doubtful debt** | No Zakat until recovery, then 1 year |
| **Irrecoverable debt** | No Zakat |

> 💡 **Maliki Position:** For a secure debt, wait until recovery, then pay Zakat for one year only, regardless of how many years passed.

---

## 5. Fourth Condition: Nisab (النصاب)

### 📌 Definition

The **Nisab** (النصاب) is the minimum threshold of wealth above which Zakat becomes obligatory. Below this threshold, no Zakat is due.

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"There is no Zakat below 5 awaq (of silver), below 5 dhawd (of camels), or below 5 awsuq (of grains)"** — Al-Bukhari (1447), Muslim (979)

### 📋 The Different Nisab Values

| Type of Wealth | Nisab | Modern Equivalent |
|---------------|-------|-------------------|
| **Gold** | 20 mithqal (dinar) | **85 grams** of pure gold |
| **Silver** | 200 dirhams | **595 grams** of pure silver |
| **Currency** | Equivalent to gold or silver | Variable by market |
| **Trade goods** | Equivalent to gold or silver | Variable |
| **Camels** | 5 camels | 5 camels |
| **Cattle** | 30 cows | 30 cows |
| **Sheep** | 40 sheep | 40 sheep |
| **Grains** | 5 wasq | Approximately **653 kg** |

### ⚠️ Which Nisab for Currency?

| School | Reference |
|--------|-----------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | **Most beneficial for the poor** (usually silver as it's cheaper) |
| 🟢 Hanafi | Gold or silver, whichever benefits poor more |
| 🔵 Shafi'i | Gold or silver |
| 🟣 Hanbali | Gold or silver |

### 📌 Must Nisab Be Maintained Throughout the Year?

| School | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | Nisab required at **beginning AND end** of year; intermediate fluctuations ignored |
| 🟢 Hanafi | Nisab at beginning AND end, fluctuations ignored |
| 🔵 Shafi'i | Nisab **throughout** the year |
| 🟣 Hanbali | Nisab throughout the year |

---

## 6. Fifth Condition: Hawl (حولان الحول)

### 📌 Definition

The **Hawl** (الحول) is the passage of a **complete lunar year** (354 days) since the wealth reached Nisab.

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"There is no Zakat on wealth until a year has passed"** — At-Tirmidhi (631)

### 📋 Wealth Subject to Hawl

| Wealth | Hawl Required? |
|--------|----------------|
| **Gold and silver** | ✅ Yes |
| **Currency** | ✅ Yes |
| **Trade goods** | ✅ Yes |
| **Livestock** | ✅ Yes |
| **Grains and fruits** | ❌ No — Zakat at harvest |
| **Treasures and mines** | ❌ No — Immediate Zakat |

### 📌 Hawl and Gains During the Year

#### Rule of Attachment (ضم الربح إلى الأصل)

| Situation | Maliki Rule |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Trade profit** | Attaches to initial capital — same Hawl |
| **Animal offspring** | Attaches to mother herd — same Hawl |
| **Monthly salary** | Each salary has its own Hawl (or choose fixed date) |
| **Inheritance/Gift** | New separate Hawl |

---

## 7. Sixth Condition: Absence of Debt (عدم الدين)

### ⚠️ MAJOR DIVERGENCE

Does debt reduce Nisab for Zakat?

| School | Debt and Zakat |
|--------|----------------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | Debt **reduces Nisab** for apparent wealth (livestock, crops) but **not** for hidden wealth (gold, silver, trade) |
| 🟢 Hanafi | Debt reduces Nisab for all wealth |
| 🔵 Shafi'i | Debt does **not reduce** Nisab |
| 🟣 Hanbali | Debt reduces Nisab for all wealth |

### 📌 Detailed Maliki Position

| Type of Wealth | Arabic | Debt Deducted? |
|----------------|--------|----------------|
| **Apparent wealth** (livestock, crops) | الأموال الظاهرة | ✅ Yes |
| **Hidden wealth** (gold, silver, trade) | الأموال الباطنة | ❌ No |

---

## 8. Special Cases

### 📌 Zakat on Wealth of Children and the Insane

| School | Zakat Obligatory? | Who Pays? |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | ✅ **Yes** | The guardian (waliy) |
| 🟢 Hanafi | ❌ No | — |
| 🔵 Shafi'i | ✅ Yes | The guardian |
| 🟣 Hanbali | ✅ Yes | The guardian |

> 💡 **Maliki Position:** Zakat is the right of the poor, not a punishment for the rich. Children and the insane own wealth, so Zakat is due.
