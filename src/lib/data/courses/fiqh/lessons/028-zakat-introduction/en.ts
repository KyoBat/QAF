**Zakat** (الزكاة) is the third pillar of Islam, a financial obligation that purifies wealth and souls. It represents the fundamental link between worshipping Allah and social solidarity, transforming wealth into a source of blessing.

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Islam is built upon five pillars: the testimony that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is His messenger, establishing the prayer, giving Zakat, pilgrimage to the House, and fasting Ramadan"** — Al-Bukhari (8), Muslim (16)

## 2. Legal Ruling (الحكم الشرعي)

### 📌 Individual Obligation (فرض عين)

Zakat is an **individual obligation** (fard 'ayn) upon every Muslim who meets the conditions. It is one of the **five pillars of Islam**.

| Type of Obligation | Proof |
|-------------------|-------|
| **Pillar of Islam** | Hadith of the 5 pillars (Al-Bukhari, Muslim) |
| **Quranic Obligation** | More than 30 verses associate Salat and Zakat |
| **Consensus (Ijma')** | Unanimous agreement of scholars across all eras |

### 📌 Proofs from the Quran

> **"Establish prayer and give Zakat"** — Al-Baqarah: 43
> 
> This command appears in various forms **82 times** in the Quran, demonstrating the paramount importance of Zakat.

> **"And those who hoard gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allah - give them tidings of a painful punishment. The Day when it will be heated in the fire of Hell and seared therewith will be their foreheads, their flanks, and their backs..."** — At-Tawba: 34-35

### 📌 Proofs from the Sunnah

> The Prophet ﷺ said to Mu'adh ibn Jabal رضي الله عنه when he sent him to Yemen: **"Inform them that Allah has enjoined upon them a charity (Zakat) to be taken from their rich and given to their poor"** — Al-Bukhari (1395), Muslim (19)

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Whoever possesses gold or silver and does not pay its due (Zakat), on the Day of Resurrection plates of fire will be made for him, and they will be heated in Hellfire. His sides, forehead, and back will be branded with them. Every time they cool, they will be heated again, during a day whose length is fifty thousand years, until judgment is passed among the servants"** — Muslim (987)

### 📌 Scholarly Consensus (الإجماع)

Scholars are **unanimous** on the obligation of Zakat since the time of the Companions رضي الله عنهم. Whoever denies its obligation while knowing the proofs is considered an **apostate** (kafir) by consensus.

> Abu Bakr As-Siddiq رضي الله عنه said during the Wars of Ridda: **"By Allah! I will fight whoever distinguishes between prayer and Zakat. For Zakat is the right due on wealth. By Allah! If they withhold from me a rope that they used to pay to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, I will fight them for it"** — Al-Bukhari (1400), Muslim (20)
