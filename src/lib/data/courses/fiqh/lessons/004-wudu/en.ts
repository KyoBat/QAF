# Al-Wudu (Ablution)

## 1. Definition of Wudu
**Linguistically:** Derived from *Al-Wada'ah*, which means beauty and cleanliness.
**Legally (in Sharia):** Using pure water on specific limbs (face, hands, head, and feet) in a specific manner with the intention of worship.

## 2. Conditions for the Validity of Wudu
For Wudu to be valid, the following conditions must be met:
1.  **Islam:** It is not valid from a disbeliever.
2.  **Sanity:** It is not valid from an insane person.
3.  **Discretion (Tamyiz):** It is not valid from a young child who has not reached the age of understanding (usually around 7 years).
4.  **Intention (Niyyah):** To intend purification or removing ritual impurity. The place of intention is the heart.
5.  **Pure Water:** Using water that is pure in itself and purifying (Mutlaq).
6.  **Removal of Barriers:** Removing anything that prevents water from reaching the skin (e.g., nail polish, paint, wax, glue).
7.  **Cessation of What Nullifies It:** One cannot perform Wudu while urinating or defecating; the act must have ceased.

## 3. Obligatory Acts (Faraid/Arkan) of Wudu
These are the pillars without which Wudu is invalid. There are six:

1.  **Washing the Face:** From the hairline to the chin, and from ear to ear. This includes rinsing the mouth and nose.
    **Proof:** Allah says: ﴿O you who have believed, when you rise to [perform] prayer, wash your faces...﴾ [Al-Ma'idah: 6].
2.  **Washing the Hands up to (and including) the Elbows.**
    **Proof:** ﴿...and your hands to the elbows...﴾ [Al-Ma'idah: 6].
3.  **Wiping the Head:** This includes the ears.
    **Proof:** ﴿...and wipe over your heads...﴾ [Al-Ma'idah: 6].
4.  **Washing the Feet up to (and including) the Ankles.**
    **Proof:** ﴿...and wash your feet to the ankles.﴾ [Al-Ma'idah: 6].
5.  **Order (Tartib):** Performing the acts in the order mentioned in the verse.
6.  **Continuity (Muwalah):** Washing the limbs in succession without a long pause so that the previous limb dries before washing the next.

## 4. Sunan (Recommended Acts) of Wudu
These are acts that earn reward if done but do not invalidate Wudu if omitted:
1.  **Saying "Bismillah"** at the beginning.
2.  **Using the Siwak** (toothstick) before rinsing the mouth.
3.  **Washing the hands (wrists) three times** at the start.
4.  **Rinsing the mouth and nose thoroughly** (Mubalaghah), except when fasting.
5.  **Running fingers through the beard** (if thick) and between fingers and toes (Takhlil).
6.  **Starting with the right side** (Tayammun) for the limbs that come in pairs.
7.  **Washing each limb three times** (except wiping the head, which is done once).
8.  **Supplication after Wudu:** "Ash-hadu an la ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la sharika lah, wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan 'abduhu wa rasuluh." (I bear witness that there is no god but Allah alone, with no partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger).

## 5. Nullifiers of Wudu (Nawaqid)
Wudu is broken by the following:
1.  **Whatever comes out from the two private passages:** Urine, feces, wind, prostatic fluid (Madhy), etc.
2.  **Deep Sleep:** Sleep that causes one to lose consciousness or control over oneself (where one would not know if they passed wind).
3.  **Loss of Consciousness:** Due to insanity, fainting, or intoxication.
4.  **Touching the Private Part:** Touching the sexual organ directly with the hand without a barrier (according to many scholars).
5.  **Eating Camel Meat:** Based on the specific command of the Prophet ﷺ.

## 6. Description of the Prophet's ﷺ Wudu (Step-by-Step)
