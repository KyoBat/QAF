# Al-Wudu (Ablution)

## 1. Definition of Wudu
**Linguistically:** Derived from *Al-Wada'ah*, which means beauty and cleanliness.
**Legally (in Sharia):** Using pure water on specific limbs (face, hands, head, and feet) in a specific manner with the intention of worship.

## 2. Conditions for the Validity of Wudu
For Wudu to be valid, the following conditions must be met:
1.  **Islam:** It is not valid from a disbeliever.
2.  **Sanity:** It is not valid from an insane person.
3.  **Discretion (Tamyiz):** It is not valid from a young child who has not reached the age of understanding (usually around 7 years).
4.  **Intention (Niyyah):** To intend purification or removing ritual impurity. The place of intention is the heart.
5.  **Pure Water:** Using water that is pure in itself and purifying (Mutlaq).
6.  **Removal of Barriers:** Removing anything that prevents water from reaching the skin (e.g., nail polish, paint, wax, glue).
7.  **Cessation of What Nullifies It:** One cannot perform Wudu while urinating or defecating; the act must have ceased.

## 3. Obligatory Acts (Faraid/Arkan) of Wudu
These are the pillars without which Wudu is invalid. There are six:

1.  **Washing the Face:** From the hairline to the chin, and from ear to ear. This includes rinsing the mouth and nose.
    **Proof:** Allah says: ﴿O you who have believed, when you rise to [perform] prayer, wash your faces...﴾ [Al-Ma'idah: 6].
2.  **Washing the Hands up to (and including) the Elbows.**
    **Proof:** ﴿...and your hands to the elbows...﴾ [Al-Ma'idah: 6].
3.  **Wiping the Head:** This includes the ears.
    **Proof:** ﴿...and wipe over your heads...﴾ [Al-Ma'idah: 6].
4.  **Washing the Feet up to (and including) the Ankles.**
    **Proof:** ﴿...and wash your feet to the ankles.﴾ [Al-Ma'idah: 6].
5.  **Order (Tartib):** Performing the acts in the order mentioned in the verse.
6.  **Continuity (Muwalah):** Washing the limbs in succession without a long pause so that the previous limb dries before washing the next.

## 4. Sunan (Recommended Acts) of Wudu
These are acts that earn reward if done but do not invalidate Wudu if omitted:
1.  **Saying "Bismillah"** at the beginning.
2.  **Using the Siwak** (toothstick) before rinsing the mouth.
3.  **Washing the hands (wrists) three times** at the start.
4.  **Rinsing the mouth and nose thoroughly** (Mubalaghah), except when fasting.
5.  **Running fingers through the beard** (if thick) and between fingers and toes (Takhlil).
6.  **Starting with the right side** (Tayammun) for the limbs that come in pairs.
7.  **Washing each limb three times** (except wiping the head, which is done once).
8.  **Supplication after Wudu:** "Ash-hadu an la ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la sharika lah, wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan 'abduhu wa rasuluh." (I bear witness that there is no god but Allah alone, with no partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger).

## 5. Nullifiers of Wudu (Nawaqid)
Wudu is broken by the following:
1.  **Whatever comes out from the two private passages:** Urine, feces, wind, prostatic fluid (Madhy), etc.
2.  **Deep Sleep:** Sleep that causes one to lose consciousness or control over oneself (where one would not know if they passed wind).
3.  **Loss of Consciousness:** Due to insanity, fainting, or intoxication.
4.  **Touching the Private Part:** Touching the sexual organ directly with the hand without a barrier (according to many scholars).
5.  **Eating Camel Meat:** Based on the specific command of the Prophet ﷺ.

## 6. Description of the Prophet's ﷺ Wudu (Step-by-Step)
Based on the Hadith of Uthman ibn Affan (may Allah be pleased with him) describing the Prophet's Wudu:

1.  Intend in your heart to perform Wudu.
2.  Say "Bismillah".
3.  Wash your hands (wrists) three times.
4.  Rinse your mouth and nose (sniffing water in and blowing it out) three times (preferably with one handful of water for both).
5.  Wash your face three times.
6.  Wash your right arm up to and including the elbow three times, then the left arm three times.
7.  Wipe your head once (move wet hands from the front to the back of the head and return them to the front).
8.  Wipe the ears (inside with index fingers and outside with thumbs).
9.  Wash your right foot up to and including the ankle three times, then the left foot three times.
10. Say the testimony of faith (Shahada) and the supplication.

## 7. Wiping Over the Khuffayn and Socks (Al-Masah)

Out of Allah's mercy upon His servants, He permitted wiping over leather socks (khuffayn) and regular socks instead of washing the feet, making things easier for Muslims especially in cold weather and during travel.

### Definitions

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Khuff (pl. Khuffayn)** | Leather footwear that covers the feet including the ankles |
| **Jawrab (pl. Jawrabayn)** | Socks made of cotton, wool, nylon, or similar materials |

### Legitimacy of Wiping

Wiping over the khuffayn is established through numerous authentic hadiths (Mutawatir). Imam Ahmad said: "I have no doubt about wiping over the khuffayn; there are forty hadiths from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ regarding it."

Al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated: **"I was with the Prophet ﷺ on a journey, and I bent down to remove his khuffs, but he said: 'Leave them, for I put them on while in a state of purity.' Then he wiped over them."** (Agreed upon).

### Conditions for Wiping Over Khuffayn and Socks

1. **Wearing them while in a state of complete purity:** After performing Wudu or Ghusl.
   - Evidence: The Prophet's saying: "For I put them on while in a state of purity."

2. **They must cover the feet including the ankles.**

3. **They must be pure (Tahir):** One cannot wipe over impure footwear.

4. **Wiping must be within the prescribed time period:**

| Status | Duration |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Resident** | One day and night (24 hours) |
| **Traveler** | Three days and nights (72 hours) |

> **Start of the period:** From the first wiping after breaking Wudu, according to the strongest opinion.

### How to Wipe

1. **Wet your hands with water.**
2. **Wipe over the top of the sock/khuff** from the toes towards the shin.
3. **Wipe once only** (repetition is not recommended).
4. **Wipe the right with the right hand and the left with the left hand** (or both together).

> ⚠️ **Note:** Wiping is done on the **top of the footwear**, not the bottom.

Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: **"If the religion were based on opinion, wiping the bottom of the khuff would make more sense than wiping the top. But I saw the Messenger of Allah ﷺ wiping over the top of his khuffs."** (Narrated by Abu Dawud with an authentic chain).

### What Invalidates the Wiping

Wiping becomes invalid and washing the feet becomes obligatory in these cases:

1. **Expiry of the time period:** If the period ends while one is in a state of purity, they only need to remove the socks and wash their feet (not repeat the entire Wudu).

2. **Removing the socks/khuffs:** If removed after wiping over them.
   - **Strongest opinion:** Purity is invalidated and washing the feet is required.

3. **Occurrence of major impurity:** Such as Janabah or menstruation.

### Important Questions

| Question | Answer |
| :--- | :--- |
| Can one wipe over socks with holes? | ✅ Yes, according to the strongest opinion, as long as they are still called socks |
| Can one wipe over transparent socks? | ✅ Yes, according to the strongest opinion |
| Can one wear a sock over another sock and wipe the outer one? | ✅ Yes, if the second was put on while in purity |
| What if one wears a khuff over another khuff? | Wipe over the outer one if worn while in purity |
| Can one wipe over shoes? | ✅ Yes, if they cover the ankles |

### Wiping Over Splints and Bandages (Jabirah)

**Jabirah:** What is placed over a fracture or wound, such as a cast or bandage.

**Ruling:** It is permissible to wipe over it, and the entire bandage should be wiped (not just the top).

**Difference between Khuff and Jabirah:**

| Khuff | Jabirah |
| :--- | :--- |
| Must be put on while in purity | Not required |
| Has a time limit | No time limit (until removed) |
| Only the top is wiped | The entire bandage is wiped |
| Specific to the feet | Can be on any limb |

*The Prophet ﷺ said: "He who performs Wudu like this Wudu of mine and then offers two Rak'ahs of prayer without allowing his thoughts to be distracted, his past sins will be forgiven." (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim).*
