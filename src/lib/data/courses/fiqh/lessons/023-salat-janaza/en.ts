## 📖 The Funeral Prayer (Salat Al-Janaza)

All praise be to Allah who created us, will cause us to die, then will resurrect us. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. The funeral prayer is a supplication for the deceased and a collective obligation on the community.

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Pray over your dead"** — Ibn Majah (1458)

> And he ﷺ said: **"Whoever follows a funeral until prayer is offered for it will have one qirat, and whoever follows it until burial will have two qirat." They asked: "What are the two qirat?" He said: "Like two immense mountains"** — Al-Bukhari (1325)
