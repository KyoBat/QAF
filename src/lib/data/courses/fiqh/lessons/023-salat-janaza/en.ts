| **4 Takbirat** | With du'a between each |
| **The Taslim** | One taslim according to Malikis |

### 🔷 The Four Takbirat

| Takbira | What is recited (Maliki) |

| **1st** | Opening du'a (recommended) |
| **2nd** | Prayer upon the Prophet ﷺ |
| **3rd** | Du'a for the deceased |

### 🔷 Du'as of the Funeral Prayer

**After the 2nd takbira:**

<div dir="rtl">

**اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَعَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ، إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ**

*O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad...*

</div>

**After the 3rd takbira:**

<div dir="rtl">

**اللَّهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لَهُ وَارْحَمْهُ، وَعَافِهِ وَاعْفُ عَنْهُ، وَأَكْرِمْ نُزُلَهُ، وَوَسِّعْ مُدْخَلَهُ، وَاغْسِلْهُ بِالْمَاءِ وَالثَّلْجِ وَالْبَرَدِ**

*O Allah, forgive him, have mercy on him, grant him well-being, pardon him...*

</div>

### 🔷 Imam's Position Relative to Deceased

| School | Man | Woman |

| 🟡 **Maliki** | **Middle** | **Middle** |
| 🟢 Hanafi | Chest | Middle |
| 🔵 Shafi'i | Head | Middle |
| 🟣 Hanbali | Head | Middle |

## ⚖️ Points of View of the Schools (آراء المذاهب)

| Issue | 🟡 Maliki | 🟢 Hanafi | 🔵 Shafi'i | 🟣 Hanbali |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| **Al-Fatiha** | **No Fatiha** | No Fatiha | Obligatory | Obligatory |
| **Taslim** | **One taslim** | One | Two | Two |
| **Raising hands** | **1st takbira only** | 1st only | Every takbira | Every takbira |
| **Prayer for absent** | **Not legitimate** | Not legitimate | Legitimate | Legitimate if not prayed upon |

> ⚠️ **Note:** The Maliki and Hanafi position on the prayer for the absent is that it is **not legislated**, as the Prophet's ﷺ prayer for the Negus was an exceptional case by revelation. The Shafi'is and Hanbalis permit it, especially for one who was not prayed upon or had an eminent rank in Islam.

<details>
<summary>📜 See the answer</summary>

**Analysis:**

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| If he testified shahada | He is prayed upon |
| Sin of abandonment | Doesn't exclude from prayer |
| Du'a | Ask forgiveness for him |
| Denying obligation | Different case (kufr) |
