## Introduction: Prayer in the 21st Century

<div class="scene-box">

**The Modern Muslim Facing New Challenges**

*Our era presents unprecedented situations:*

*Phones vibrating during prayer. Intercontinental travel crossing time zones. Work preventing breaks. Photos and videos everywhere. Cosmetic surgeries altering the body.*

*How does Fiqh — developed in the 8th century — respond to these challenges?*

*Through its universal principles: no excessive hardship, no harm, facilitation in difficulty.*

</div>

> **Foundational Principle:** The rules of Fiqh are flexible in application while remaining firm in principles.

## Chapter 1: Phones and Electronic Devices

### Your Phone Rings During Prayer

<div class="scene-box">

**Scenario**

*Ahmad is praying. His phone rings loudly.*

*What should he do?*

</div>

#### Scholarly Rulings

| Action | Status | Justification |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Turn it off with a simple movement** | Permitted | Light movement, avoids disturbance |
| **Put it on silent** | Permitted | One or two gestures |
| **Answer and speak** | Nullifies prayer | Deliberate speech outside prayer |
| **Let it ring** | Makruh | Disturbs oneself and others |

> **Advice:** Put your phone on silent BEFORE prayer. This is good adab.

#### Reading Quran from Phone During Prayer?

| School | Opinion |
|--------|---------|
| **Majority** | Permitted — the medium doesn't change the content |
| **Condition** | Don't make excessive movements to navigate |

> **Note:** The paper Mushaf remains preferable out of respect.

## Chapter 2: Prayer at Work

### Balancing Work and Salat

<div class="scene-box">

**Common Dilemma**

*Salim works in France. Lunch break is 12-1pm. But Dhuhr enters at 1:15pm in winter.*

*What should he do?*

</div>

#### Permissible Solutions

| Situation | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **Sufficient break** | Pray during the break |
| **No break but possible** | Ask for 5 min — most employers agree |
| **Complete impossibility** | Jam' (combining) according to conditions |

#### Jam' (Combining) for Work

| School | Jam' for work? |
|--------|----------------|
| **Maliki** | Not permitted except travel/rain/illness |
| **Hanafi** | Not permitted (except travel) |
| **Shafi'i** | Not permitted except valid excuse |
| **Hanbali** | Permitted in case of real need (harajah) |

> **Ibn Taymiyyah's Position:** Jam' is permitted in case of need (hajah) even without travel, but should not become a habit.

#### Praying in a Confined Space

| Situation | Ruling |
|-----------|--------|
| **Cramped office** | Pray on your chair if otherwise impossible |
| **No prayer room** | A clean corner, approximate Qibla direction suffices |
| **Colleagues present** | No shame — it's a right |

---

## Chapter 3: Modern Travel

### Airplanes and Time Zones

<div class="scene-box">

**Scenario**

*Fatima takes a Paris-Tokyo flight (12h). She departs at 2pm (Dhuhr has passed). She lands at 9am local time (next day).*

*How many prayers must she perform during the flight?*

</div>

#### Principles

1. **Prayers follow the sun**, not local time
2. **Observe through the window:** sunset = Maghrib, red disappears = Isha, dawn = Fajr
3. **If sky not visible:** use a prayer app in airplane mode with GPS position

#### In the Airplane

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Pray seated?** | Permitted if standing is impossible or prohibited |
| **Qibla direction** | Do your best, apps help |
| **Wudu impossible** | Tayammum on the seat or clean armrest |
| **Qasr (shorten)?** | Yes, if travel > 80-90 km |

#### Jet Lag

| Situation | Ruling |
|-----------|--------|
| **Flying west (day lengthens)** | More prayers (Dhuhr, 'Asr, etc. may recur) |
| **Flying east (night shortens)** | Less time between prayers — jam' permitted |
| **On arrival: what time to pray?** | Local time of arrival location |

## Chapter 4: Photos and Videos

### Praying in a Filmed Location

<div class="scene-box">

**Modern Context**

*Mosques have security cameras. Tourists photograph. Tarawih livestreams broadcast globally.*

*Does this affect the validity of prayer?*

</div>

#### Rulings

| Situation | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Being filmed unknowingly** | Doesn't affect prayer |
| **Deliberately filming your prayer** | Makruh if for showing off (riya') |
| **Haram photos broadcast** | Permitted for benefit |
| **Selfie during prayer** | Nullifies prayer (movements + distraction) |

> **Beware of Riya':** Filming your prayer for social media touches on minor shirk. The Prophet ﷺ said: "What I fear most for you is the minor shirk: riya'." — Ahmad

## Chapter 5: Body Modifications

### Tattoos and Prayer

<div class="scene-box">

**Frequent Question**

*A person got a tattoo before Islam or in ignorance. Is their prayer valid?*

</div>

#### Status of Tattooing

| Aspect | Ruling |
|--------|--------|
| **Getting a tattoo** | Haram — clear hadith (curse on tattooer and tattooed) |
| **Existing tattoo** | Removal is NOT obligatory if painful/dangerous |
| **Prayer with tattoo** | VALID — the sin doesn't affect validity |
| **Repenting** | Obligatory, but no need for removal |

> **Source:** "Allah has cursed the woman who tattoos and the one who gets tattooed." — Bukhari (5937), Muslim (2125)

### Cosmetic Surgery

| Type | Ruling |
|------|--------|
| **Reconstructive (accident, burns)** | Permitted |
| **Purely cosmetic** | Haram according to majority (changing Allah's creation) |
| **Effect on prayer** | None — prayer remains valid |

### Prosthetics and Implants

| Element | Wudu | Prayer |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Removable dentures** | Can be removed to clean underneath | Valid |

## Chapter 6: Specific Work Situations

### Professions with Irregular Hours

<div class="scene-box">

**Affected Professions**

*Surgeons in operations. Long-haul pilots. Night shift workers. Firefighters on duty.*

*How do they manage prayers?*

</div>

#### Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Pray on time** | Primary obligation |
| **Jam' if necessary** | Combine Dhuhr-'Asr or Maghrib-'Isha |
| **Qasr if traveling** | Reduce 4 rak'at to 2 |
| **Pray seated if impossible** | In operating room, airplane, etc. |

| Situation | Ruling |
|-----------|--------|
| **Short operation** | Pray before or after |
| **Long operation (several hours)** | Jam' before the operation |
| **Vital emergency** | Pray after, even out of time — no sin |

## Chapter 7: Music and Sounds

### Hearing Music During Prayer

<div class="scene-box">

**Scenario**

*Yusuf prays at home. His neighbor plays music loudly.*

*Is his prayer valid?*

</div>

#### Rulings

| Situation | Validity |
|-----------|----------|
| **Involuntary music** | Prayer VALID — no control |
| **Focusing on it** | Makruh, but valid |
| **Deliberately playing music** | Invalidates prayer (intentional distraction) |

## Chapter 8: Modern Hygiene Questions

### Perfumes with Alcohol

<div class="scene-box">

**Frequent Question**

*Perfume contains alcohol. Can one pray with it?*

</div>

#### Analysis

| Type of Alcohol | Ruling |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Grape/date alcohol (khamr)** | Najis according to majority |
| **Industrial alcohol (synthetic ethanol)** | Tahir according to many contemporaries |
| **Commercial perfumes** | Generally synthetic alcohol — permitted |

> **Prevalent view today:** Perfume alcohol is pure because it is not "khamr" (wine) and evaporates instantly.

### Hand Sanitizer and Wudu

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Does it replace wudu?** | NO — it's not water |
| **Using it after wudu?** | Permitted, doesn't nullify wudu |
| **Traces on hands** | No problem for prayer |

## Final Principle

<div class="scene-box">

**Ease Within Difficulty**

*Fiqh is not there to complicate but to accompany the Muslim in all situations of their life.*

## Closing Supplication

> **"O Allah, make Your worship easy for us, and help us to remember You, thank You, and worship You well."**

---

**May Allah accept from us and from you**

*Modern challenges are not obstacles to prayer, but opportunities to demonstrate our attachment to Allah in all circumstances.*
