When I love him, I am his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes, and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would surely give it to him, and were he to seek refuge in Me, I would surely grant him refuge."**

#### 📖 Legal Ruling — ⚠️ DIVERGENCE

| School | Ruling | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | **Sunnah Mu'akkadah** | Constant practice of the Prophet |
| 🟢 **Hanafi** | **WAJIB** (but not Fard) | "Al-Witr is haqq" (Abu Dawud) |
| 🔵 **Shafi'i** | Sunnah Mu'akkadah | Same as Maliki |
| 🟣 **Hanbali** | Sunnah Mu'akkadah | But close to wajib |

> ⚠️ **Hanafi Clarification:** Wajib ≠ Fard. Wajib is lower than Fard: one who denies Witr is not kafir (unlike one who denies the 5 prayers), but its deliberate abandonment is sinful.

> 💡 **Consensus of the Four Schools:** Despite the disagreement on the exact ruling, all agree that Witr should NEVER be deliberately abandoned.

#### 🎯 Best Time

## 💡 SPIRITUAL ADVICE FOR PRESERVING THE NAWAFIL

### 1. Start Small and Be Consistent

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Aisha's Wisdom**

**The Prophet ﷺ said:** "The deeds most loved by Allah are those done regularly, even if they are small"

</div>

**📍 Source:** Bukhari (6464), Muslim (782)

> 💡 **Strategy:** Better 2 rak'at daily for 10 years than 100 rak'at for one week!

---

### 2. Pray Them at Home

**Hadith:** "The best prayer of a person is in his home, except the obligatory prayer" (Bukhari 731)

**Wisdoms:**
- Bless your home
- Avoid showing off
- Involve your family
- Your children will see you and emulate

---

### 3. Vary the Times

**Anti-routine strategy:**
- Duha: Sometimes early, sometimes late in the morning
- Witr: Sometimes after Isha, sometimes at end of night
- Qiyam: Sometimes short and many, sometimes long and few

---

### 4. Benefit from Travel and Facilitations

**During travel:**
- Maintain minimum: Witr and 2 rak'at before Fajr
- Make up when resident

**When tired:**
- Sitting is better than not at all
- Remember the Hadith Qudsi of Nawafil

---

## 🎓 PRACTICAL Q&A

### Q1: I missed my Rawatib, can I make them up?

**A:** Yes!
- Fajr Sunnah: after sunrise (before Duha)
- Other Rawatib: after their obligatory prayer until the next prayer

---

### Q2: Should I pray Witr if I already prayed Tarawih with Witr?

**A:** No, one Witr per night is sufficient. If the imam ends with Witr, that's your Witr for the night.

---

### Q3: Can I repeat Istikharah?

**A:** Yes, until the path becomes clear.

---

### Q4: Do women have the same merits for Nawafil?

**A:** Absolutely! The rewards are identical. They pray at home (even better for them).

---

## 🤲 Closing Supplication

> **Allahumma a'inni 'ala dhikrika wa shukrika wa husni 'ibadatik**
