## Introduction

Menstruation and postpartum bleeding are natural matters that Allah has decreed for the daughters of Adam. Islamic law has established specific rulings regarding purification and worship during these times. The Prophet ﷺ said to Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) when she menstruated during Hajj: **"This is something that Allah has decreed for the daughters of Adam."** (Agreed upon).

## Part One: Menstruation (Hayd)

### 1. Definition of Menstruation

**Linguistically:** Flowing; it is said "the valley menstruated" when it flowed.
**Legally:** Natural blood that exits from a woman's uterus at known times, not due to illness or injury.

### 2. Age of Menstruation

| Limit | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Earliest age it begins** | Nine lunar (Hijri) years |
| **Age of cessation (menopause)** | Usually between 45-55 years |

> **Note:** What a girl sees before the age of nine is not menstruation, and similarly what a woman sees after menopause.

### 3. Duration of Menstruation

| Limit | Duration |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Minimum** | No minimum (even an hour) according to the strongest opinion |
| **Maximum** | Fifteen days according to the majority |
| **Average** | Six or seven days |

The Prophet ﷺ said to Hamnah bint Jahsh: **"Consider yourself menstruating for six or seven days in Allah's knowledge, then perform Ghusl."** (Narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawud).

### 4. Characteristics of Menstrual Blood

Menstrual blood has distinguishing characteristics:

1. **Color:** Black or dark red.
2. **Smell:** Has a distinctive unpleasant odor.
3. **Consistency:** Thick and heavy.
4. **Clotting:** Usually does not clot.

### 5. Signs of Purity from Menstruation

A woman knows she is pure by one of two signs:

1. **White Discharge (Al-Qassah Al-Bayda'):** A white fluid that exits from the uterus at the end of menstruation.
2. **Complete Dryness:** The blood stops completely, so if a cotton pad is inserted, it comes out clean.

Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) said to women: **"Do not rush until you see the white discharge."** (Reported by Al-Bukhari as Mu'allaq).

---

## Part Two: Postpartum Bleeding (Nifas)

### 1. Definition of Nifas

**Linguistically:** From "nafs" (blood/soul) or from "tanaffus" (relief).
**Legally:** Blood that exits from the uterus due to childbirth.

### 2. Duration of Nifas

| Limit | Duration |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Minimum** | No minimum (she may become pure after a day or two) |
| **Maximum** | Forty days |
| **Average** | Forty days or less |

Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: **"The woman in postpartum bleeding used to sit (refrain from prayer) for forty days during the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ."** (Narrated by Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi).

> **Note:** If a woman becomes pure before forty days, she must perform Ghusl and pray. If the blood returns within the forty days, it is Nifas. If it continues after forty days, it is Istihada (abnormal bleeding).

### 3. Blood Before Delivery

- **If it comes two or three days before delivery with signs of labor (contractions):** It is considered Nifas.
- **If it comes before that:** It is not Nifas, but abnormal blood.

## Part Three: What is Prohibited for the Menstruating Woman and the One in Nifas

### Shared Prohibitions

| Ruling | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Prayer** | The Prophet ﷺ said: "Isn't it that when she menstruates, she neither prays nor fasts?" (Agreed upon) |
| **2. Fasting** | Same hadith as above |
| **3. Circumambulating the Ka'bah** | The Prophet ﷺ said to Aisha: "Do what the pilgrim does except do not circumambulate the House." (Agreed upon) |
| **4. Staying in the Mosque** | The Prophet ﷺ said: "I do not permit the mosque for a menstruating woman or one in a state of major impurity." (Narrated by Abu Dawud) |
| **5. Sexual Intercourse** | Allah says: ﴿So keep away from women during menstruation and do not approach them until they are pure.﴾ [Al-Baqarah: 222] |
| **6. Touching the Mushaf** | According to the majority of scholars |

### What is Permissible for the Menstruating Woman

1. **Remembrance of Allah, supplication, and glorification.**
2. **Reciting Quran** without touching the Mushaf (according to the stronger opinion, for need such as memorization and review).
3. **Passing through the mosque** without staying.
4. **Intimacy without intercourse** (between the navel and knee).
5. **Attending gatherings of knowledge and remembrance.**
6. **All acts of Hajj except Tawaf.**

## Part Four: Istihada (Abnormal Uterine Bleeding)

### 1. Definition of Istihada

**Linguistically:** From the pattern of "istif'al" from "hayd."
**Legally:** Blood that exits from the uterus outside the times of menstruation and Nifas; it is blood from a vein called "al-'adhil."

### 2. Characteristics of Istihada Blood

| Menstrual Blood | Istihada Blood |
| :--- | :--- |
| Black or dark red | Light red or yellow |
| Thick and heavy | Thin and light |
| Has an unpleasant odor | No odor |
| Does not clot | Clots |

### 3. Ruling on the Mustahada

The woman with Istihada is **pure** and has the same ruling as pure women. She must:

1. **Pray** at its time.
2. **Fast** if it is Ramadan.
3. **Everything obligatory upon the pure woman.**

**How to purify:**
- Wash the private area.
- Place a cotton pad or sanitary napkin.
- Perform Wudu for each prayer after its time enters.

The Prophet ﷺ said to Fatimah bint Abi Hubaysh: **"Perform Wudu for every prayer."** (Narrated by Al-Bukhari).

### 4. Cases of the Mustahada

| Case | Ruling |
| :--- | :--- |
| **She has a known habit** | She sits for the days of her habit then performs Ghusl and prays |
| **She can distinguish (knows the characteristics of menstrual blood)** | She acts according to the distinction |
| **No habit and no distinction** | She considers herself menstruating for six or seven days each month |

## Part Five: Rulings on Purity and Ghusl

### When is Ghusl Required?

1. **End of menstruation:** After seeing the sign of purity (white discharge or dryness).
2. **End of Nifas:** When the blood stops or after completing forty days.

### Description of Ghusl from Menstruation and Nifas

It is the same as Ghusl from Janabah, with the recommendation to:

1. **Remove the traces of blood well.**
2. **Use something with a pleasant scent** (musk or perfume) on the area of the blood.

Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said to Asma' regarding Ghusl from menstruation: **"One of you takes her water and sidr (lote tree leaves) and purifies herself well, then she pours water over her head... then she takes a piece of cloth scented with musk and purifies herself with it."** (Narrated by Muslim).

*Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) said: "We went out with the Prophet ﷺ mentioning nothing but Hajj. When we came to Sarif, I got my period. The Prophet ﷺ entered upon me while I was crying and said: 'What makes you cry?' I said: 'By Allah, I wish I had not come out this year.' He said: 'What is the matter with you? Perhaps you got your period?' I said: 'Yes.' He said: 'This is something that Allah has decreed for the daughters of Adam. Do what the pilgrim does except do not circumambulate the House until you become pure.'"* (Agreed upon).
