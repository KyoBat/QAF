## The Traveler's Prayer (Salat Al-Musafir)

All praise be to Allah who lightened the obligations for His servants while traveling. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ who said: **"Allah loves that His dispensations be taken just as He dislikes that His prohibitions be committed."** Travel is a situation that deserves special facilitations in worship.

> Allah تعالى says: **"And when you travel through the land, there is no blame upon you for shortening the prayer"** — An-Nisa: 101

## 1. Traveler's Dispensations (رُخَص السفر)

### 📋 Facilitations granted to the traveler

| Facilitation | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Shortening (Al-Qasr)** | Reducing 4-rak'ah prayers to 2 |
| **Combining (Al-Jam')** | Combining two prayers at one time |
| **Breaking the fast** | Permitted to not fast Ramadan (make up later) |
| **Wiping khuff for 3 days** | Instead of one day for residents |
| **Leaving the Rawatib** | Except Witr and Fajr according to some |

---

## 2. Shortening the Prayer (القصر)

### 📌 Definition

**Qasr** means praying 2 rak'at instead of 4 for Dhuhr, Asr, and Isha prayers.

### 📋 Prayers affected

| Prayer | Normal Count | While Traveling |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Fajr** | 2 rak'at | 2 rak'at (no change) |
| **Dhuhr** | 4 rak'at | **2 rak'at** |
| **Asr** | 4 rak'at | **2 rak'at** |
| **Maghrib** | 3 rak'at | 3 rak'at (no change) |
| **Isha** | 4 rak'at | **2 rak'at** |

### ⚠️ Ruling on shortening - DIFFERENCE OF OPINION

| School | Ruling | Detail |
|--------|--------|--------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | **Sunna Mu'akkada** | Strongly recommended, not obligatory |
| 🟢 Hanafi | **Wajib (obligatory)** | The traveler must shorten |
| 🔵 Shafi'i | Permitted (Rukhsa) | Better but not obligatory |
| 🟣 Hanbali | Sunna Mu'akkada | Preferable to shorten |

> 💡 **Maliki Position:** Shortening is a Sunna Mu'akkada. One who completes the prayer while traveling, his prayer is valid but he left what is better.

### 📌 Evidence for shortening

> Aisha رضي الله عنها said: **"The prayer was prescribed as two rak'at, then the resident's prayer was increased while the traveler's prayer was maintained"** — Al-Bukhari (350), Muslim (685)

> Ibn 'Umar رضي الله عنهما said: **"I accompanied the Prophet ﷺ and he never prayed more than two rak'at while traveling, and the same with Abu Bakr, 'Umar, and 'Uthman"** — Al-Bukhari (1102)

## 3. Travel Distance (مسافة القصر)

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE

| School | Minimum Distance | Modern Equivalent |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | **4 burud (48 Hashimi miles)** | **≈ 81 km** |
| 🟢 Hanafi | 3 days walk | ≈ 80-90 km |
| 🔵 Shafi'i | 2 marhalah (16 farsakh) | ≈ 80-89 km |
| 🟣 Hanbali | 16 farsakh | ≈ 80 km |

> 💡 **Practical consensus:** Approximately **80 km** according to the majority of scholars.

### 📌 Maliki Clarifications

- Distance is calculated **one way**, not round trip
- Mode of transport doesn't affect the ruling (plane, car, train)
- Intention to travel this distance is required **from the start**

### 📌 When does the journey begin?

| School | Start of traveler status |
|--------|-------------------------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | **When leaving the buildings of one's city** |
| 🟢 Hanafi | When leaving the dwellings of one's city |
| 🔵 Shafi'i | When passing the buildings |
| 🟣 Hanbali | When passing the buildings |

---

## 4. Duration of Stay (مدة الإقامة)

### ⚠️ MAJOR DIFFERENCE

| School | Max duration to shorten | Explanation |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | **4 complete days (excluding arrival/departure)** | Beyond = resident, pray complete |
| 🟢 Hanafi | **15 days** | Intention of 15 days = resident |
| 🔵 Shafi'i | 4 days (without arrival/departure) | Like Maliki |
| 🟣 Hanbali | More than 4 prayers | ~4 days |

### 📌 Practical Application (Maliki)

| Planned stay duration | Status | Action |
|----------------------|--------|--------|
| 1-4 complete days | Traveler | Shorten + combine |
| 5 days or more | Resident | Pray complete |
| Uncertain of duration | Traveler | Shorten up to 18 days max |

> 💡 **Maliki Example:** You travel to Paris from Monday to Friday (5 days). You shorten Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday-Thursday, then pray complete on Friday.

### 📌 Special Cases

| Situation | Maliki Ruling |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Indefinite waiting** | Remains traveler up to 18 days |
| **Studies abroad** | Resident once intending to stay |
| **Temporary work (e.g., 2 months)** | Resident because intention > 4 days |

---

## 5. Combining Prayers (الجمع)

### 📌 Definition

**Jam'** means praying two consecutive prayers together, either by advancing the second (Taqdim) or delaying the first (Ta'khir).

### 📋 Prayers that can be combined

| Group 1 | Group 2 |
|---------|---------|
| Dhuhr + Asr | Maghrib + Isha |

> ⚠️ **Fajr is never combined** with another prayer.

### 📋 Types of combining

| Type | Arabic | Description | Example |
|------|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Jam' Taqdim** | جمع تقديم | Advance the 2nd prayer | Pray Asr at Dhuhr time |
| **Jam' Ta'khir** | جمع تأخير | Delay the 1st prayer | Pray Dhuhr at Asr time |

### ⚠️ Ruling on combining - DIFFERENCE

| School | While traveling | Other causes |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | **Permitted** | Permitted for rain, illness |
| 🟢 Hanafi | **Not permitted** (except at Arafat/Muzdalifa) | Not permitted |
| 🔵 Shafi'i | Permitted | Permitted for rain, illness |
| 🟣 Hanbali | Permitted | Permitted for rain, illness, need |

> 💡 **Hanafi Position:** Hanafis do not permit combining while traveling, except during Hajj at Arafat and Muzdalifa. This is their historical position based on a different understanding of the hadiths.

### 📌 Evidence for combining

> Ibn 'Abbas رضي الله عنهما said: **"The Prophet ﷺ would combine Dhuhr and Asr when traveling, and Maghrib and Isha"** — Al-Bukhari (1107)

> Mu'adh رضي الله عنه reported that the Prophet ﷺ, during the Battle of Tabuk, combined Dhuhr with Asr and Maghrib with Isha — Muslim (706)

## 6. Practical Rulings (أحكام عملية)

### 📌 Traveler praying behind a resident

| Situation | Ruling |
|-----------|--------|
| **Traveler behind resident imam** | Must complete 4 rak'at (follow the imam) |
| **Traveler catches part of prayer** | Complete what he missed (4 total) |

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"What you catch, pray it, and what you miss, complete it"** — Al-Bukhari (636)

### 📌 Traveler leading residents

| Situation | Recommended ruling |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Traveler imam + resident followers** | Prays 2, tells residents to complete |
| **Formula to say** | "Complete your prayer, for we are travelers" |

### 📌 Rawatib (voluntary prayers) while traveling

| School | Ruling |
|--------|--------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | Leave Rawatib except **Witr and Fajr Sunnah** |
| 🟢 Hanafi | Permissible to leave them |
| 🔵 Shafi'i | Better to maintain them |
| 🟣 Hanbali | Leave them except Witr |

> Ibn 'Umar رضي الله عنهما said: **"I accompanied the Prophet ﷺ while traveling and I never saw him pray voluntary prayers"** — Al-Bukhari (1101)

---

## 7. Modern Cases (حالات معاصرة)

### 📌 Air travel

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Does distance count?** | Yes, it's distance not duration |
| **Praying on the plane?** | Permitted if time might pass |
| **Qibla direction** | Do your best, prayer is valid |

### 📌 Layovers and connections

| Situation | Ruling |
