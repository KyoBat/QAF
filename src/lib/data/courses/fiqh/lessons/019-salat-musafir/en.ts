<details>
<summary>📜 View the answer</summary>

**Jurisprudential Analysis:**

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Distance** | 100 km — exceeds 80 km ✅ |

| **Settlement** | She does not reside in the work city |
| **Ruling** | Disputed issue — completing is safer |

| **Practical rule** | Pray when time enters where you are |
| **Combining in-flight** | Permitted for the traveler |
