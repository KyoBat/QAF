## 📖 Prayer of the Late-Comer (Masbuq)

All praise be to Allah who encouraged us to pray in congregation. May peace and blessings be upon the one who said: **"Prayer in congregation is superior to praying alone by twenty-seven degrees."** The masbuq is one who missed part of the prayer with the imam, and he has special rulings that must be learned.

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"When you hear the iqama, walk to the prayer with tranquility and dignity, do not rush. What you catch, pray it, and what you miss, complete it"** — Agreed upon (Al-Bukhari 636, Muslim 602)

---

## 🔍 Definition of the Masbuq

**Masbuq (Late-comer):** The worshipper who missed one or more rak'at from the congregational prayer with the imam.

**Mudrik (One who caught up):** One who caught the entire prayer with the imam from its beginning.

**Lahiq (One who joins):** One who missed part of the prayer due to an excuse (like sleeping or forgetting) while being with the imam.

## 🔍 When is One Considered to Have Caught the Rak'a?

### The Golden Rule:

> **Whoever catches the bowing with the imam has caught the rak'a**

| What is caught | Ruling |
|----------------|--------|
| **Caught the bowing** | Caught the complete rak'a |
| **Caught the imam after bowing** (in prostration or sitting) | Missed this rak'a |
| **Caught only the final tashahhud** | Caught the virtue of congregation but missed all rak'at |

### 📌 Proof that catching the bowing = catching the rak'a

On the authority of Abu Hurayra رضي الله عنه, the Prophet ﷺ said: **"Whoever catches a rak'a of the prayer has caught the prayer"** — Agreed upon (Al-Bukhari 580, Muslim 607)

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 The Scene of Abu Bakra — The Foundation for Catching the Bowing**

*Abu Bakra رضي الله عنه was arriving for the prayer...*

*He found the Prophet ﷺ already in bowing!*

*He was afraid of missing the rak'a... so **he bowed before even reaching the row!***

*After the prayer, he mentioned what he had done to the Prophet ﷺ...*

**The Prophet ﷺ:** "May Allah increase your eagerness, but do not do it again"

</div>

**📍 Narrator:** Abu Bakra رضي الله عنه — Al-Bukhari (783)

> 📌 **Lesson from the scene:** He did not order him to repeat the rak'a, which proves he caught it.

## 🔷 Conditions for Catching the Bowing

For the masbuq to be considered as having caught the rak'a by catching the bowing, the following is required:

| Condition | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **1. Catch the imam in bowing** | Before the imam raises his head |
| **2. Be tranquil in the bowing** | Merely bending is not sufficient |
| **3. Join the imam in bowing** | Even for a brief moment |

---

## 🔷 What the Masbuq Catches with the Imam

### The Juristic Rule:

> **What the masbuq catches with the imam is the beginning of his prayer, and what he makes up is the end**

### Application of the Rule:

| What he catches | What he does after the imam's salam |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| **One rak'a of Maghrib** | He stands and prays one rak'a with Fatiha and surah (aloud), then sits for tashahhud, then stands for the third with Fatiha only (silently) |
| **Two rak'at of Dhuhr** | He stands and prays two rak'at with Fatiha only (silently) |
| **One rak'a of Fajr** | He stands and prays one rak'a with Fatiha and surah (aloud) |
| **Three rak'at of 'Isha** | He stands and prays one rak'a with Fatiha only (silently) |

---

## 💡 How to Make Up What Was Missed

### Detailed Steps:

#### 1. Wait for the imam's salam
- The masbuq does not stand until the imam makes at least the first salam
- **Proof:** His statement ﷺ: **"Do not precede me in bowing, prostration, or standing"** — Muslim (414)

#### 2. Stand to make up
- He stands while making takbir after the imam's salam
- He does not make salam with the imam

#### 3. Recitation when making up

| What he makes up | What he recites |
|------------------|-----------------|
| **The first rak'at** (those he missed) | Fatiha and surah |
| **The last rak'at** (after the first and second) | Fatiha only |

#### 4. Aloud and silent

| Type of prayer | Rule |
|----------------|------|
| **Audible prayer** (Fajr/Maghrib/'Isha) | He recites aloud where he would if praying alone |
| **Silent prayer** (Dhuhr/'Asr) | He recites silently in all that he makes up |
