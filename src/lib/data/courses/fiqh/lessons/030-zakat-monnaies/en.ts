Gold and silver are the most important types of wealth subject to Zakat. By extension, modern fiat currency (banknotes and coins) as well as bank holdings follow the same rules.

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Any owner of gold or silver who does not pay its due (Zakat) will have plates of fire made for him on the Day of Resurrection..."** — Muslim (987)
