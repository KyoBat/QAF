## The Pillars of Prayer (Arkan as-Salah)

All praise be to Allah who taught us how to stand before Him. May peace and blessings be upon the seal of His messengers who said: **"Pray as you have seen me pray"** — Reported by Al-Bukhari (631).

> The pillars are the columns of prayer without which it cannot stand. Whoever omits a pillar, whether by forgetfulness or intentionally, his prayer is invalid until he performs it.

## The Fourteen Pillars (According to the Relied-Upon View Among Hanbalis and Shafi'is)

| No. | Pillar | Reference Proof | Practical Benefit |
|-----|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Standing for the one who is able in obligatory prayer** | The Prophet's ﷺ statement to 'Imran ibn Husayn: "Pray standing, if you cannot, then sitting" — Al-Bukhari (1117) | Stand upright, don't rush to bow before you are settled |
| 2 | **The opening takbir (takbirat al-ihram)** | The Prophet ﷺ said: "Its prohibition is the takbir" — Abu Dawud (618), authenticated by Al-Albani | Begin the prayer with "Allahu Akbar" while raising your hands according to the Sunnah |
| 3 | **Recitation of Al-Fatiha** | "There is no prayer for the one who does not recite Al-Fatiha" — Al-Bukhari (756) | Recite it slowly and reflect on its meanings |
| 4 | **Bowing (ruku')** | Allah تعالى says: **﴾ O you who believe, bow and prostrate ﴿** (Al-Hajj: 77) and the hadith of the one who prayed badly — Al-Bukhari (757) | Bow until your hands reach your knees, with your back straight |
| 5 | **Rising from bowing** | In the hadith of the one who prayed badly: "Then raise up until you stand straight" — Al-Bukhari (757) | Raise your head and back until you are completely upright |
| 6 | **Standing straight after bowing** | Same hadith, Muslim (397) adds: "until you stand straight" | Don't rush to prostration, pause for a moment |
| 7 | **Prostrating on seven limbs** | "I was ordered to prostrate on seven bones" — Al-Bukhari (812), Muslim (490) | The forehead with the nose, both hands, both knees, the tips of both feet |
| 8 | **Rising from prostration** | In the hadith of the one who prayed badly: "Then rise" — Al-Bukhari (757) | Rise gently, maintaining the order of limbs |
| 9 | **Sitting between the two prostrations** | "Then prostrate until you are tranquil in prostration, then rise until you are tranquil sitting" — Al-Bukhari (757) | Sit for a short moment and say: Rabbi ghfir li |
| 10 | **Tranquility (tuma'ninah) in all pillars** | In the hadith of the one who prayed badly: "Go back and pray, for you have not prayed" for neglecting tranquility — Al-Bukhari (757) | Each position has sufficient time for its obligatory dhikr |
| 11 | **The final tashahhud** | Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "When one of you sits in prayer, let him say: At-tahiyyatu lillah..." — Muslim (402) | Memorize the transmitted tashahhud formula |
| 12 | **Sitting for the final tashahhud** | Deduced from the same hadith, as tashahhud cannot be performed except while sitting | Sit in a stable manner, placing your hands as reported |
| 13 | **Sending prayers upon the Prophet ﷺ after the final tashahhud** | The Prophet ﷺ said: "When one of you makes tashahhud, let him send prayers upon me" — Al-Bukhari (6357) | The minimum: Allahumma salli 'ala Muhammad wa 'ala ali Muhammad |
| 14 | **The salam in order** | "Its permission to exit is the salam" — Abu Dawud (618), and hadith of Ibn Mas'ud "He would give salam to his right and to his left" — Muslim (582) | Give at least one salam while respecting the order of pillars as the Prophet prayed |

> **Note:** The pillar of "order" is included in following the Prophetic sequence — no pillar should precede another. This is indicated by his statement ﷺ: **"Pray as you have seen me pray."**

## Tuma'ninah (Tranquility) — The Neglected Pillar

### Definition of Tuma'ninah
It is calmness in each pillar, sufficient time for the limbs to settle and for the obligatory dhikr to be completed. It is a pillar according to the majority (Shafi'is, Hanbalis, and Malikis).

### Proofs for Tuma'ninah as a Pillar

#### 1. The Hadith of the One Who Prayed Badly — The Foundation in This Chapter

On the authority of Abu Hurayra رضي الله عنه: **A man entered the mosque and prayed, then he came to greet the Prophet ﷺ who said to him: "Go back and pray, for you have not prayed." He returned and prayed as he had done before, then came back to greet the Prophet ﷺ who said: "Go back and pray, for you have not prayed" — three times. The man said: By the One who sent you with the truth, I do not know how to do better, teach me. He said:**

> **"When you stand for prayer, say the takbir, then recite what is easy for you from the Quran, then bow until you are tranquil in your bowing, then rise until you stand straight, then prostrate until you are tranquil in your prostration, then rise until you are tranquil sitting, and do likewise throughout your entire prayer"** — Agreed upon (Al-Bukhari 757, Muslim 397)

> 📌 **Key Point:** The Prophet's ﷺ expression "until you are tranquil" in every pillar proves the obligation of tranquility, and that abandoning it invalidates the prayer.

#### 2. The Prohibition of Stealing from Prayer

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"The worst thief is the one who steals from his prayer."** He was asked: O Messenger of Allah, how does he steal from his prayer? He said: **"He does not complete his bowing or his prostration."** — Reported by Ahmad and Ad-Darimi, authenticated by Al-Albani.

#### 3. Non-Acceptance of the Prayer of One Who Does Not Straighten His Back

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"The prayer is not accepted if the person does not straighten his back in bowing and prostration."** — Reported by Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi, authenticated.

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Allah does not look at the prayer of a man who does not straighten his back between his bowing and prostration."** — Reported by Ahmad, authenticated by Al-Albani.

#### 4. The Prohibition of Pecking Like a Crow

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Do not peck like a crow, and do not spread out like wild beasts."** — Reported by Ahmad, authenticated by Al-Albani.

### How to Achieve Tuma'ninah?

| Pillar | Minimum Tranquility | Sunnah of Prolongation |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Bowing** | To settle in bowing for the time it takes to say "Subhana rabbi al-'azim" once | Three times or more |
| **Rising from bowing** | To stand completely straight | Prolong it with the reported adhkar |
| **Prostration** | To settle in prostration for the time it takes to say "Subhana rabbi al-a'la" once | Three times and multiply supplications |
| **Sitting between prostrations** | To settle sitting for the time it takes to say "Rabbi ghfir li" once | Repeat it and add more |

> ⚠️ **Important Warning:** Many worshippers neglect tuma'ninah, especially in rising from bowing and sitting between prostrations. This invalidates the prayer according to the majority!

## Mind Map for Understanding the Pillars

1. **Before prostration:** Standing → Opening Takbir → Al-Fatiha → Bowing → Rising → Standing Straight.
2. **Prostration and between them:** First Prostration → Brief Sitting → Second Prostration.
3. **Closing the prayer:** Final Tashahhud → Prayers upon the Prophet ﷺ → Legislated Supplications → Salam in Order.

Divide the pillars into three stages so the sequence becomes fixed in your mind.

## Quick Comparisons Between Schools

- **Malikis:** Add intentions and reflection points among the pillars to reinforce khushu' (humility).
- **Hanafis:** Consider some of what we mentioned as wajibat (obligations) rather than arkan (pillars), so know your school when seeking fatwa.
- **The Majority:** Agree on the essentials, with differences often being terminological.

> The Rule: *Whoever omits a pillar intentionally, his prayer is invalid. Whoever omits it by forgetfulness must return to it as long as he is still in prayer, then perform the prostration of forgetfulness at the end.*

## Training Steps

- **Tracking Card:** Write the fourteen pillars, and place next to each pillar a checkbox (✓) to confirm you performed it in your last prayer.
- **Audio Learning:** Listen to a model prayer from an accomplished reciter and observe his calm transitions.
- **Practical Application:** Pray two rak'at of practice in front of a qualified companion so they can point out any deficiency in the pillars.

## Evaluation Questions

1. What is the proof for the obligation of tuma'ninah?
2. How do you redo the prayer if you forgot the bowing?
3. Why did the scholars consider the salam a pillar?
4. What is the difference between sitting for the first and final tashahhud in terms of ruling?

O Allah, teach us what benefits us, benefit us from what You have taught us, and make us among the humble ones who fulfill the pillars of prayer according to the guidance of Your noble Prophet.
