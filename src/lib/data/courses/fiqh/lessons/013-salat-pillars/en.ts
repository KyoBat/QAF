## 📖 The Pillars of Prayer (Arkan as-Salah)

All praise be to Allah who taught us how to stand before Him. May peace and blessings be upon the seal of His messengers who said: **"Pray as you have seen me pray"** — Reported by Al-Bukhari (631).

> The pillars are the columns of prayer without which it cannot stand. Whoever omits a pillar, whether by forgetfulness or intentionally, his prayer is invalid until he performs it.

## 📚 The Fourteen Pillars (According to the Relied-Upon View Among Hanbalis and Shafi'is)

| No. | Pillar | Reference Proof | Practical Benefit |
|-----|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Standing for the one who is able in obligatory prayer** | The Prophet's ﷺ statement to 'Imran ibn Husayn: "Pray standing, if you cannot, then sitting" — Al-Bukhari (1117) | Stand upright, don't rush to bow before you are settled |
| 2 | **The opening takbir (takbirat al-ihram)** | The Prophet ﷺ said: "Its prohibition is the takbir" — Abu Dawud (618), authenticated by Al-Albani | Begin the prayer with "Allahu Akbar" while raising your hands according to the Sunnah |
| 3 | **Recitation of Al-Fatiha** | "There is no prayer for the one who does not recite Al-Fatiha" — Al-Bukhari (756) | Recite it slowly and reflect on its meanings |
| 4 | **Bowing (ruku')** | Allah تعالى says: **﴾ O you who believe, bow and prostrate ﴿** (Al-Hajj: 77) and the hadith of the one who prayed badly — Al-Bukhari (757) | Bow until your hands reach your knees, with your back straight |
| 5 | **Rising from bowing** | In the hadith of the one who prayed badly: "Then raise up until you stand straight" — Al-Bukhari (757) | Raise your head and back until you are completely upright |
| 6 | **Standing straight after bowing** | Same hadith, Muslim (397) adds: "until you stand straight" | Don't rush to prostration, pause for a moment |
| 7 | **Prostrating on seven limbs** | "I was ordered to prostrate on seven bones" — Al-Bukhari (812), Muslim (490) | The forehead with the nose, both hands, both knees, the tips of both feet |
| 8 | **Rising from prostration** | In the hadith of the one who prayed badly: "Then rise" — Al-Bukhari (757) | Rise gently, maintaining the order of limbs |
| 9 | **Sitting between the two prostrations** | "Then prostrate until you are tranquil in prostration, then rise until you are tranquil sitting" — Al-Bukhari (757) | Sit for a short moment and say: Rabbi ghfir li |
| 10 | **Tranquility (tuma'ninah) in all pillars** | In the hadith of the one who prayed badly: "Go back and pray, for you have not prayed" for neglecting tranquility — Al-Bukhari (757) | Each position has sufficient time for its obligatory dhikr |
| 11 | **The final tashahhud** | Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "When one of you sits in prayer, let him say: At-tahiyyatu lillah..." — Muslim (402) | Memorize the transmitted tashahhud formula |
| 12 | **Sitting for the final tashahhud** | Deduced from the same hadith, as tashahhud cannot be performed except while sitting | Sit in a stable manner, placing your hands as reported |
| 13 | **Sending prayers upon the Prophet ﷺ after the final tashahhud** | The Prophet ﷺ said: "When one of you makes tashahhud, let him send prayers upon me" — Al-Bukhari (6357) | The minimum: Allahumma salli 'ala Muhammad wa 'ala ali Muhammad |
| 14 | **The salam in order** | "Its permission to exit is the salam" — Abu Dawud (618), and hadith of Ibn Mas'ud "He would give salam to his right and to his left" — Muslim (582) | Give at least one salam while respecting the order of pillars as the Prophet prayed |

> **Note:** The pillar of "order" is included in following the Prophetic sequence — no pillar should precede another. This is indicated by his statement ﷺ: **"Pray as you have seen me pray."**

## 🔷 Tuma'ninah (Tranquility) — The Neglected Pillar

### Definition of Tuma'ninah
It is calmness in each pillar, sufficient time for the limbs to settle and for the obligatory dhikr to be completed. It is a pillar according to the majority (Shafi'is, Hanbalis, and Malikis).

### Proofs for Tuma'ninah as a Pillar

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 The Hadith of the One Who Prayed Badly — The Foundation in This Chapter**

*A man entered the mosque while the Prophet ﷺ was sitting with his companions...*

*The man prayed quickly, then came to greet the Prophet ﷺ.*

**The Prophet ﷺ:** "Go back and pray, for you have not prayed"

*The man returned and prayed the same way... then came back to greet.*

**The Prophet ﷺ:** "Go back and pray, for you have not prayed"

*This happened **three times**!*

**The man:** *[confused]* "By the One who sent you with the truth, I do not know how to do better, teach me!"

**The Prophet ﷺ:** *[with gentleness]* "When you stand for prayer, say the takbir, then recite what is easy for you from the Quran, then bow until you are tranquil in your bowing, then rise until you stand straight, then prostrate until you are tranquil in your prostration, then rise until you are tranquil sitting, and do likewise throughout your entire prayer"

</div>

**📍 Narrator:** Abu Hurayra رضي الله عنه — Agreed upon (Al-Bukhari 757, Muslim 397)

> 📌 **Lesson from the scene:** The expression "until you are tranquil" in every pillar proves the obligation of tranquility, and that abandoning it invalidates the prayer.

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 The Prohibition of Stealing from Prayer**

*The Prophet ﷺ was warning his companions about a grave evil...*

**The Prophet ﷺ:** "The worst thief is the one who steals from his prayer"

**The Companions:** *[surprised]* "O Messenger of Allah, how does he steal from his prayer?"

**The Prophet ﷺ:** "He does not complete his bowing or his prostration"

</div>

#### 📚 Other hadiths on tranquility

| Hadith | Source |
|--------|--------|
| **"The prayer is not accepted if the person does not straighten his back in bowing and prostration"** | Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi ✅ |
| **"Allah does not look at the prayer of a man who does not straighten his back between his bowing and prostration"** | Ahmad ✅ |
| **"Do not peck like a crow, and do not spread out like wild beasts"** | Ahmad ✅ |

### How to Achieve Tuma'ninah?

| Pillar | Minimum Tranquility | Sunnah of Prolongation |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Bowing** | To settle in bowing for the time it takes to say "Subhana rabbi al-'azim" once | Three times or more |
| **Rising from bowing** | To stand completely straight | Prolong it with the reported adhkar |
| **Prostration** | To settle in prostration for the time it takes to say "Subhana rabbi al-a'la" once | Three times and multiply supplications |
| **Sitting between prostrations** | To settle sitting for the time it takes to say "Rabbi ghfir li" once | Repeat it and add more |

> ⚠️ **Important Warning:** Many worshippers neglect tuma'ninah, especially in rising from bowing and sitting between prostrations. This invalidates the prayer according to the majority!

## 🗺️ Mind Map for Understanding the Pillars

1. **Before prostration:** Standing → Opening Takbir → Al-Fatiha → Bowing → Rising → Standing Straight.
2. **Prostration and between them:** First Prostration → Brief Sitting → Second Prostration.
3. **Closing the prayer:** Final Tashahhud → Prayers upon the Prophet ﷺ → Legislated Supplications → Salam in Order.

Divide the pillars into three stages so the sequence becomes fixed in your mind.

## ⚖️ Comparison of Schools on Prayer Pillars

### 📌 Number of Pillars According to Each School

| School | Number of Pillars | Main Differences |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | 14 pillars | Add **intention** as a pillar, consider **audible/silent recitation** as pillar according to context |
| 🟢 **Hanafi** | 6 pillars only | Consider much of what is mentioned as **obligations** not pillars (like tashahhud and sending blessings on the Prophet ﷺ) |
| 🔵 **Shafi'i** | 13 pillars | Close to Hanbalis, with details on **order of pillars** |
| 🟣 **Hanbali** | 14 pillars | As mentioned in the table above |

### 📌 Schools' Positions on Reciting Al-Fatiha

| School | Ruling for Imam | Ruling for Follower | Proof Relied Upon |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | Pillar, prayer invalid if omitted intentionally | Not obligatory for follower in audible prayers | Listening attentively to imam is obligatory |
| 🟢 **Hanafi** | Obligatory but not pillar, compensated by prostration of forgetfulness | Not obligatory for follower at all | "Whoever has an imam, the imam's recitation is his recitation" — weak but they applied it |
| 🔵 **Shafi'i** | Pillar without which prayer is invalid | Obligatory for follower in every rak'a | "No prayer for one who does not recite Al-Fatiha" — Bukhari |
| 🟣 **Hanbali** | Pillar in every rak'a | Not obligatory for follower in audible prayers | Reconciling the proofs |

> 📌 **Maliki view retained:** Al-Fatiha is a pillar for the imam and individual, and not obligatory for the follower in audible prayer due to the obligation of listening attentively.

### 📌 Schools' Positions on Tuma'ninah (Tranquility)

| School | Ruling on Tuma'ninah | Effect of Omitting It |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | Pillar without which prayer is invalid | Prayer is void |
| 🟢 **Hanafi** | Obligatory but not pillar | Prayer is valid with sin, compensated by prostration of forgetfulness |
| 🔵 **Shafi'i** | Pillar without which prayer is invalid | Prayer is void |
| 🟣 **Hanbali** | Pillar without which prayer is invalid | Prayer is void |

> ⚠️ **Warning:** The majority view is that tuma'ninah is a pillar. One who pecks his prayer, his prayer is invalid according to three schools!

## 🎯 Training Steps

- **Tracking Card:** Write the fourteen pillars, and place next to each pillar a checkbox (✓) to confirm you performed it in your last prayer.
- **Audio Learning:** Listen to a model prayer from an accomplished reciter and observe his calm transitions.
- **Practical Application:** Pray two rak'at of practice in front of a qualified companion so they can point out any deficiency in the pillars.
