# At-Tayammum (Dry Ablution)

Tayammum is the lawful substitute for Wudu and Ghusl when water is unavailable or its use is harmful. It is one of the unique blessings granted to the Ummah of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.

## 1. Definition of Tayammum

**Linguistically:** It means "to intend" or "to aim for."
**Legally (in Sharia):** It is wiping the face and hands with pure earth (Sa'id Tayyib) with the intention of purification when water cannot be used.

## 2. When is Tayammum Permitted? (Valid Excuses)

A Muslim may perform Tayammum instead of Wudu or Ghusl in the following situations:

### A. Absence of Water
When water is not available after searching for it, or it is too far to reach.

**Proof:** Allah says: ﴿...and you find no water, then seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and your hands﴾ [An-Nisa: 43].

### B. Illness or Fear of Harm
If a sick person fears that using water will worsen the illness, delay recovery, or cause a new ailment.

### C. Extreme Cold
If the water is extremely cold and one genuinely fears harm from using it, and there is no way to heat it.

**Proof:** The Prophet ﷺ approved of Amr ibn al-As (may Allah be pleased with him) when he performed Tayammum due to severe cold during the expedition of Dhat as-Salasil and led his companions in prayer. The Prophet ﷺ did not rebuke him. (Narrated by Abu Dawud, authenticated by Al-Albani).

### D. Need to Preserve Water
If one has only a small amount of water needed for drinking (for oneself, companions, or animals), they may preserve it and perform Tayammum.

## 3. What Can Be Used for Tayammum?

Tayammum is performed with **pure earth (Sa'id Tayyib)**, which includes anything that rises from the surface of the earth and is of its nature: dust, sand, rocks, or even walls made of mud or stone.

**Proof:** The Prophet ﷺ said: "The earth has been made for me a place of prayer and a means of purification." (Agreed upon - Bukhari & Muslim).

## 4. How to Perform Tayammum (Step-by-Step)

The authentic method of Tayammum as taught by the Prophet ﷺ is simple:

1. **Intention:** Intend in your heart to purify yourself for prayer (or to remove impurity).
2. **Say Bismillah:** Say "In the name of Allah."
3. **Strike the Earth Once:** Strike the ground (or any pure earth surface) with the palms of both hands once.
4. **Wipe the Face:** Wipe your entire face with your palms.
5. **Wipe the Hands:** Wipe the back of your right hand with your left palm, and the back of your left hand with your right palm (up to the wrists).

**Proof:**
Ammar ibn Yasir (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet ﷺ said: "It would have been sufficient for you to do this," and he struck the ground once with his palms, then dusted them off, then wiped the back of his left hand with his right palm (or the back of his right hand with his left palm), then wiped his face. (Agreed upon - Bukhari & Muslim).

## 5. What Invalidates Tayammum?

Tayammum is nullified by:

1. **Everything that nullifies Wudu:** (Urine, feces, passing wind, deep sleep, etc.).
2. **Finding Water:** For those who performed Tayammum due to its absence. The rule is: "When water is found, Tayammum becomes invalid."
3. **Removal of the Excuse:** Such as recovery from illness, or the cold becoming bearable, or finding a way to heat the water.

---

**Benefit:** A single Tayammum is valid for multiple prayers as long as it is not invalidated, just like Wudu.

*Islam is a religion of ease. Allah says: ﴿Allah does not intend to make difficulty for you, but He intends to purify you﴾ [Al-Ma'idah: 6].*
