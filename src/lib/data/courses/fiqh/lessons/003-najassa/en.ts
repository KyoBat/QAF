# Najassa (Impurities) and its Rulings

## 1. Definition of Najassa
**Linguistically:** It means filth or dirtiness; its opposite is cleanliness and purity.
**Legally (in Sharia):** It is a specific filth that prevents the validity of prayer and other acts of worship where purity is a condition.

## 2. Types of Impurities
Among the most important impure substances that a Muslim must know are:

### A. Urine and Feces of Humans
Both are impure by the consensus of scholars.
**Proof:** The Hadith of the Bedouin who urinated in the mosque, whereupon the Prophet ﷺ said: "Pour a bucket of water over his urine." (Narrated by Al-Bukhari).

### B. Al-Madhy and Al-Wadi
- **Al-Madhy (Pre-seminal fluid):** A thin, sticky white fluid released during foreplay or sexual thoughts. It is impure; one must wash the private part and perform Wudu (ablution).
- **Al-Wadi:** A thick white fluid that comes out after urination. It is impure like urine.

### C. Dung and Urine of Animals Whose Meat is Not Eaten
Such as the dung of donkeys and predatory animals.
**Proof:** The Prophet ﷺ said regarding dung: "It is Riks (filth)." (Narrated by Al-Bukhari).

### D. Spilled Blood (Dam Masfuh)
This refers to a large amount of flowing blood. Small amounts of blood are overlooked and excused.
**Proof:** Allah says: ﴿or spilled blood or the flesh of swine - for indeed, it is impure﴾ [Al-An'am: 145].

### E. Swine Flesh (Pork)
It is impure in all its parts.
**Proof:** The previous verse: ﴿for indeed, it is impure (Rijs)﴾.

### F. The Dog
The saliva of a dog is impure.
**Proof:** The Prophet ﷺ said: "The purification of the vessel of one of you, if a dog licks it, is to wash it seven times, the first of them with soil." (Narrated by Muslim).

### G. Dead Animals (Carrion)
This refers to what has died naturally without lawful slaughter (except for fish, locusts, and insects that do not have flowing blood).
**Proof:** The Prophet ﷺ said: "Two dead things and two types of blood have been made lawful for us. As for the two dead things, they are the fish and the locust..." (Narrated by Ibn Majah).

## 3. Categories of Impurity (Physical and Ritual)

### Physical Impurity (Ayni / Hissiyya)
This is an impurity that has a physical substance or essence, such as feces or blood. This cannot be purified in itself (e.g., you cannot turn feces into something pure by washing it); rather, it must be removed.

### Ritual Impurity (Hukmi)
This is a legal status preventing the validity of prayer, occurring when impurity falls onto a pure place (like a garment affected by urine). This becomes pure by removing the essence and trace of the impurity.

## 4. How to Purify Impurities

The general rule for purification is to use **pure water** (Mutlaq), which removes the essence, color, and smell of the impurity.

1.  **If the impurity is on the ground:** It is sufficient to pour water over it until it covers it and the essence of the impurity is gone (as in the Hadith of the Bedouin).
2.  **If it is on clothing or the body:** It must be washed with water until the essence of the impurity is removed. If a color or smell remains that is difficult to remove, it is excused.
3.  **Major Impurity (Dog):** It must be washed seven times, one of them with soil.
4.  **Transformation (Istihala):** Some scholars hold that if an impurity completely transforms into a different substance (like wine turning into vinegar by itself), it becomes pure.

## 5. Examples and Applications

-   **Example 1:** If drops of urine fall on your clothes, you only need to wash the specific area affected by the urine, not the entire garment.
-   **Example 2:** If you walk with clean shoes on dry, impure ground, your shoes do not become impure because dry impurity does not transfer. However, if the ground is wet, the shoes may become impure and must be washed or wiped well with soil.

*Always remember that Islam is a religion of cleanliness and purity. Striving for purity is one of the reasons for gaining the love of Allah: ﴿Indeed, Allah loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves.﴾*
