## Introduction

From the completeness and comprehensiveness of Islam is that it clarified for the Muslim the etiquettes related to relieving oneself, preserving his dignity and maintaining his purity. Salman Al-Farisi (may Allah be pleased with him) said: **"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ taught us everything, even how to relieve ourselves."** (Narrated by Muslim).

## Etiquettes of Entering the Restroom

### 1. Supplication Before Entering

Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When the Prophet ﷺ entered the restroom, he would say: **"O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the male and female devils."** (Agreed upon).

- **Al-Khubuth:** Male devils.
- **Al-Khaba'ith:** Female devils.

### 2. Entering with the Left Foot First

Because the left is for harmful things and the right is for good and noble matters.

### 3. Not Taking Anything with Allah's Name on It

It is disliked to enter with anything containing Allah's name or the Quran unless necessary (like a phone with Quran apps).

## Prohibitions While Relieving Oneself

### 1. Facing or Turning One's Back to the Qiblah

Abu Ayyub Al-Ansari (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: **"When you go to relieve yourselves, do not face the Qiblah nor turn your backs to it. Instead, face east or west."** (Agreed upon).

| Location | Ruling |
| :--- | :--- |
| Open desert | ❌ Prohibited to face or turn back to Qiblah |
| Buildings (bathrooms) | ✅ Permissible according to the correct opinion |

**Evidence for permissibility in buildings:** Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: **"I climbed onto Hafsah's house and saw the Prophet ﷺ relieving himself facing Syria with his back to the Ka'bah."** (Agreed upon).

### 2. Urinating in Stagnant Water

Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet ﷺ **"forbade urinating in stagnant water."** (Narrated by Muslim).

### 3. Urinating on Pathways or in Shaded Areas

Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: **"Beware of the two cursed ones."** They said: "What are the two cursed ones, O Messenger of Allah?" He said: **"The one who relieves himself in people's pathways or in their shade."** (Narrated by Muslim).

### 4. Urinating in Holes

There may be animals inside that could harm him.

### 5. Speaking While Relieving Oneself

Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) narrated: **"A man passed by the Prophet ﷺ while he was urinating and greeted him, but he did not respond."** (Narrated by Muslim).

### 6. Urinating While Standing Without Need

The default is to urinate while sitting as it is more concealing and further from being soiled by impurity. It is permissible to stand when needed or if one is safe from soiling.

## Etiquettes of Exiting the Restroom

### 1. Exiting with the Right Foot First

The opposite of entering, because the right is for leaving unpleasant places.

### 2. Supplication After Exiting

Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that when the Prophet ﷺ exited the restroom, he would say: **"(I seek) Your forgiveness."** (Narrated by Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi, authenticated).

It is also recommended to say: **"Praise be to Allah who has removed harm from me and granted me wellbeing."** (Narrated by Ibn Majah).

## Istinja and Istijmar

### Definitions

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Istinja** | Removing what exits from the private parts with water |
| **Istijmar** | Removing what exits from the private parts with stones or their substitutes (tissues) |

### Ruling on Istinja

**Obligatory** after urination or defecation, and Wudu is not valid without it.

### Conditions for Istijmar

1. **Using something pure:** Cannot use something impure.
2. **Using something absorbent:** Like stones and paper, not smooth like glass.
3. **At least three wipes:** Until cleanliness is achieved.
4. **The impurity has not spread beyond its place:** If it spreads, water becomes obligatory.

### Evidence for Istijmar

Salman (may Allah be pleased with him) said: **"He (the Prophet ﷺ) forbade us from performing Istinja with less than three stones."** (Narrated by Muslim).

### What Cannot Be Used for Istijmar

| Item | Reason |
| :--- | :--- |
| Bones | Food of the jinn |
| Dung | Fodder for their animals |
| Food | Disrespecting the blessing |
| Anything with Allah's name | Honoring Allah |
| The right hand | For dignity |

Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: **"When one of you performs Istijmar, let him do it an odd number of times."** (Agreed upon).

Salman (may Allah be pleased with him) said: **"He forbade us from facing the Qiblah when defecating or urinating, from performing Istinja with the right hand, from performing Istinja with less than three stones, and from performing Istinja with dung or bones."** (Narrated by Muslim).

## The Best Method of Cleansing

| Method | Ruling |
| :--- | :--- |
| Water only | ✅ Sufficient |
| Stones only (with conditions) | ✅ Sufficient |
| Stones then water | ✅ **Best** |

**Evidence:** The people of Quba used to cleanse with water, so this was revealed about them: ﴿In it are men who love to purify themselves, and Allah loves those who purify themselves.﴾ [At-Tawbah: 108].

## Important Issues

### 1. Istibra' (Ensuring Complete Emptying)

It is ensuring the private part is free from remaining urine.

**For men:** By shaking gently, coughing, or walking a little until certain the remainder has exited.

**For women:** She does not need Istibra' due to the shortness of her urinary tract.

### 2. Waswasa (Obsessive Doubts) in Purification

Whoever is afflicted with waswasa should seek refuge in Allah from Satan, not pay attention to it, and build upon certainty.

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"If one of you feels something in his stomach and is unsure whether something came out or not, he should not leave the mosque until he hears a sound or smells an odor."** (Narrated by Muslim).
