## 📖 The Prostration of Forgetfulness in Detail

All praise be to Allah who established a remedy for every deficiency in prayer. May peace and blessings be upon the one who forgot in his prayer to teach us. The prostration of forgetfulness is from Allah's mercy upon His servants, as He made it a means to rectify the deficiency and error that occurs in prayer due to forgetfulness.

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"I am only a human being like you, I forget as you forget. When I forget, remind me"** — Agreed upon (Al-Bukhari 401, Muslim 572)

## 🔍 Definition of the Prostration of Forgetfulness

**As-Sahw linguistically:** Inattention and forgetfulness.

**Terminologically:** Two prostrations that the worshipper performs to repair the deficiency that occurred in his prayer due to addition, omission, or doubt.

## The Three Causes of the Prostration of Forgetfulness

### First Cause: Addition in Prayer

| Type of Addition | Ruling | Proof |
|------------------|--------|-------|
| **Adding a physical pillar** (like an extra bowing or prostration) | Prostration of forgetfulness after salam | Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud on addition — Al-Bukhari (1226) |
| **Adding a complete rak'a** | If he realizes before completing it, he returns, sits, makes tashahhud and prostrates | Hadith of Dhu al-Yadayn — Al-Bukhari (1229) |
| **Adding a statement in the wrong place** (like reciting Al-Fatiha in prostration) | No prostration according to the correct view | Because it is a legislated dhikr in general |
| **Speaking out of forgetfulness** | Prostration of forgetfulness after salam | Hadith of Dhu al-Yadayn — Muslim (573) |

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 Hadith of Dhu al-Yadayn — The Foundation for Addition**

*The Prophet ﷺ was leading the companions in the Dhuhr or 'Asr prayer...*

*After only two rak'at... **he made salam!***

*He stood up and went to a palm trunk in the qibla direction and leaned against it, his face showing signs of anger.*

*Some people rushed out saying: "The prayer has been shortened! The prayer has been shortened!"*

*Abu Bakr and 'Umar were present, but they **hesitated to speak** out of respect for him ﷺ.*

*But a man called **Dhu al-Yadayn** dared...*

**Dhu al-Yadayn:** "O Messenger of Allah, have you forgotten or has the prayer been shortened?"

**The Prophet ﷺ:** "I have not forgotten and it has not been shortened"

**Dhu al-Yadayn:** "Yes, you have forgotten, O Messenger of Allah!"

**The Prophet ﷺ:** *[turning to the companions]* "Is it as Dhu al-Yadayn says?"

**The Companions:** "Yes!"

*So he stepped forward, prayed what he had missed, made salam, then **prostrated twice** after the salam.*

</div>

**📍 Narrator:** Abu Hurayra رضي الله عنه — Agreed upon (Al-Bukhari 1229, Muslim 573)

> 📌 **Lesson from the scene:** The Prophet ﷺ prostrated **after salam** because he had added in the prayer (salam before completion and speaking).

---

### Second Cause: Omission in Prayer

| Type of Omission | Ruling | Proof |
|------------------|--------|-------|
| **Omitting a pillar** | Not compensated by prostration of forgetfulness, must be performed | Because prayer is not valid without the pillar |
| **Deliberately omitting an obligation** | Prayer is invalid | For deliberately leaving the obligation |
| **Forgetting an obligation** | Prostration of forgetfulness before salam | Hadith of Ibn Buhayna — Al-Bukhari (829) |

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 Hadith of Abdullah ibn Buhayna — The Foundation for Omission**

*The Prophet ﷺ was leading the companions in the Dhuhr prayer...*

*After the second rak'a, **he stood up directly** without sitting for the first tashahhud!*

*The companions looked at each other... but they stood with him without reminding him.*

*He ﷺ completed the prayer and sat for the final tashahhud...*

*The people were waiting for his salam... but he did something different:*

*He made takbir while sitting, then **prostrated twice before making salam**, then made salam.*

</div>

**📍 Narrator:** Abdullah ibn Buhayna رضي الله عنه — Agreed upon (Al-Bukhari 829, Muslim 570)

> 📌 **Lesson from the scene:** The Prophet ﷺ prostrated **before salam** because he had omitted from the prayer (left out the first tashahhud).

### Third Cause: Doubt in Prayer

#### a) Doubt with one option predominating

| Situation | What to do | When to prostrate |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Doubts whether he prayed 3 or 4 and thinks it's 4 | He builds on what predominates (4) | He prostrates after salam |

**Proof:** Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud رضي الله عنه that the Prophet ﷺ said: **"When one of you doubts in his prayer, let him seek what is correct and complete upon it, then prostrate two prostrations"** — Agreed upon (Al-Bukhari 401, Muslim 572)

#### b) Equal doubt (nothing predominates)

| Situation | What to do | When to prostrate |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Doubts whether he prayed 3 or 4 and nothing predominates | He builds on the lesser (3) and adds a rak'a | He prostrates before salam |

**Proof:** Hadith of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri رضي الله عنه that the Prophet ﷺ said: **"When one of you doubts in his prayer and does not know how many he prayed, three or four, let him discard the doubt and build on what he is certain of, then prostrate two prostrations before making salam. If he has prayed five, they will make his prayer even, and if he has prayed a complete four, they will be a humiliation for Shaytan"** — Reported by Muslim (571)

## Golden Rule on When to Prostrate for Forgetfulness

| Cause | When to Prostrate | Reasoning |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Addition** | After salam | Because the prostration is an addition, so it's fitting for it to be after |
| **Omission** | Before salam | To repair the deficiency before exiting the prayer |
| **Doubt with predominance** | After salam | Because he built on probability, as if he added |
| **Equal doubt** | Before salam | Because he built on the lesser, as if he omitted |

> 💡 **Summary Rule:** Addition and predominance = after salam, Omission and equality = before salam.

## How to Perform the Prostration of Forgetfulness

### Steps for prostration before salam:
1. After finishing the final tashahhud and prayers upon the Prophet ﷺ
2. Make takbir and prostrate for the first prostration
3. Say in it: **"Subhana rabbi al-a'la"** (once or more)
4. Rise while making takbir and sit briefly
5. Make takbir and prostrate for the second prostration like the first
6. Rise while making takbir and make salam

### Steps for prostration after salam:
1. Make salam from your prayer
2. Make takbir and prostrate for the first prostration
3. Rise while making takbir and sit briefly
4. Make takbir and prostrate for the second prostration
5. Rise and make the final tashahhud
6. Make salam

> **Note:** Scholars have differed regarding the tashahhud after the prostration of forgetfulness performed after salam, and the safer approach is to do it.

## Special Rulings for the Prostration of Forgetfulness

### 1. The follower's (ma'mum) forgetfulness behind the imam

| Situation | Ruling |
|-----------|--------|
| The follower forgets alone | He does not prostrate, the imam carries it for him |
| The imam forgets | The follower follows him in prostration obligatorily |
| The latecomer forgets in what he makes up | He prostrates for himself after completing his prayer |

**Proof:** His statement ﷺ: **"The imam is only appointed to be followed... and when he prostrates, prostrate"** — Agreed upon

### 2. Repeated forgetfulness in the same prayer

| Situation | Ruling |
|-----------|--------|
| He forgets twice or more | One prostration at the end of prayer suffices |
| A pre-salam and post-salam forgetfulness combine | The pre-salam one is given precedence according to the correct view |

### 3. Forgetting the prostration of forgetfulness

| Situation | Ruling |
|-----------|--------|
| He remembers shortly after salam | He prostrates even if the gap was long according to the correct view |
| The gap is very long or he left the mosque | It is waived and he owes nothing |

### 4. Forgetfulness in voluntary prayer

Its ruling is like forgetfulness in obligatory prayer, due to the generality of the proofs.
