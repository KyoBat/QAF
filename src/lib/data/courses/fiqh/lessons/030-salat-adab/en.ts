> *"Prayer is a garden. Its etiquettes are the flowers that beautify it."* — Without the ādāb, prayer remains valid but loses its inner beauty.

## 🎬 Opening Scene — The Prophet's ﷺ Prayer

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 When the Prophet ﷺ Entered Prayer**

*Anas ibn Mālik narrates...*

*"When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stood for prayer..."*

*"...it was as if he no longer recognized us."*

*"His face would change."*

*"We would hear a sound like a boiling pot..."*

*"...coming from his chest, from weeping."*

*He was entirely in another world.*

*Present before his Lord.*

*Body and soul.*

</div>

> 💡 **The Lesson:** The ādāb are not formalities. They are the doors to khushū' — that presence of heart that transforms prayer into a dialogue with Allah.

### 🔷 4. Facing the Qiblah

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 The Historic Turn**

*For sixteen months, the Muslims prayed toward Jerusalem...*

*The Prophet ﷺ would often raise his gaze toward the sky...*

*Awaiting a divine command...*

*Then Allah revealed:*

**"So turn your face toward al-Masjid al-Ḥarām."**

</div>

#### 📍 Rules of the Qiblah

| Situation | Rule | Evidence |
|-----------|------|----------|
| **Close to Makkah** | Exact direction required | Consensus |
| **Far from Makkah** | General direction suffices | Al-Tirmidhī (342) |

## 📚 Etiquettes During Prayer

### 🔷 1. Khushū' — The Heart of Prayer

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Two Prayers**

*Imagine two men...*

*Both perform the same prayer...*

*Same movements. Same words.*

**The First:** His mind wanders. He thinks about his business, his car, his meal...

**The Second:** His heart is present. He contemplates every word. He feels he is before Allah.

*Which one truly prayed?*

**The Prophet ﷺ:** "How many people who pray get nothing from their prayer except fatigue!"

</div>

**📍 Source:** Aḥmad, Al-Nasā'ī (in meaning)

#### 🔑 Keys to Khushū'

1. **Prepare your heart beforehand** — A few moments of silence
2. **Understand what you recite** — Learn the translation
3. **Fix your gaze on the place of prostration** — Don't scan the room
4. **Pray as if it were your last** — The Prophet ﷺ advised this
5. **Chase away thoughts** — Constantly return to presence

> **Practical tip:** If a thought invades you, imagine that Allah is watching you now. Refocus on Him.

---

### 🔷 2. Gaze During Prayer

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Where to Look?**

*'Āisha reports:*

*"The Prophet ﷺ would pray with his head lowered, looking at the ground."*

*When he entered the Ka'bah, his gaze did not pass beyond his place of prostration.*

</div>

#### 📌 Position of Gaze According to Schools

| Moment | 🟡 Mālikī | 🟢 Ḥanafī | 🔵 Shāfi'ī | 🟣 Ḥanbalī |
|--------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| **Standing (Qiyām)** | Place of prostration | Place of prostration | Place of prostration | Place of prostration |
| **Bowing (Rukū')** | Between the feet | Between the feet | Tips of feet | Place of prostration |
| **Prostrating (Sujūd)** | Tip of nose | Tip of nose | Tip of nose | Tip of nose |
| **Sitting (Tashahhud)** | The moving index finger | The index finger | The index finger | The index finger |

> ⚠️ **Forbidden:** Raising the gaze toward the sky during prayer.
> The Prophet ﷺ said: "People must stop raising their eyes to the sky during prayer, or their sight will be taken away!" — Muslim (428)

---

### 🔷 3. Tranquility of the Limbs (Ṭuma'nīnah)

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 The Man Who Prayed Badly**

*A man entered the mosque...*

*He prayed quickly, like a bird pecking...*

*The Prophet ﷺ was watching him.*

*The man came to greet the Prophet ﷺ.*

**The Prophet ﷺ:** "Go back and pray, for you have not prayed."

*The man returned. Prayed the same way.*

*Came back to greet.*

**The Prophet ﷺ:** "Go back and pray, for you have not prayed."

*This repeated three times!*

**The man:** "By the One who sent you with the truth, I don't know how to do better! Teach me!"

**The Prophet ﷺ:** "When you stand for prayer, say the takbīr, then recite what is easy for you from the Qur'an, then bow until you are at ease in your bowing, then rise until you are standing straight, then prostrate until you are at ease in your prostration..."

</div>

**📍 Source:** Al-Bukhārī (757), Muslim (397)

#### 📊 Rules of Ṭuma'nīnah

| Position | Minimum Duration | What Nullifies It |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Rukū'** | Time to say "Subḥān Allāh" | Rising before being still |
| **I'tidāl** (standing after rukū') | Time to say "Subḥān Allāh" | Going to sujūd immediately |
| **Sujūd** | Time to say "Subḥān Allāh" | Rising before being still |
| **Jalsah** (sitting between prostrations) | Time to say "Subḥān Allāh" | Returning to sujūd immediately |

> 💡 **The golden rule:** Each limb must return to its place before the next movement. This is a pillar (rukn) according to the majority of scholars.
