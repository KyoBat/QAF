## The Rain Prayer (Salat Al-Istisqa')

All praise be to Allah who sends down rain after despair and spreads His mercy. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. When drought strikes and rain is scarce, Muslims turn to Allah imploring His mercy.

> The Prophet ﷺ went out to pray the Istisqa' prayer, and he faced the Qibla while supplicating — Al-Bukhari (1012)
