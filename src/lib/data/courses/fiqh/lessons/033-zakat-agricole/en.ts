Zakat on agricultural products (الزروع والثمار) is a divine obligation on harvests. It differs from other types of Zakat by not requiring a Hawl.

> Allah ﷻ says: **"وَآتُوا حَقَّهُ يَوْمَ حَصَادِهِ"** — *"And give its due on the day of its harvest"* — Surah Al-An'am (6:141)

---

## 3. The Agricultural Nisab

### 📌 5 Awsuq (خمسة أوسق)

| Measure | Equivalent |
|---------|------------|
| **1 wasq** | 60 sa' |
| **5 awsuq** | 300 sa' |
| **Modern weight** | ≈ **653 kg** (based on average wheat) |

### 📌 Reference Hadith

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"There is no Zakat below 5 awsuq"** — Al-Bukhari (1484) and Muslim (979)

|---------|-------------------|
| **Wheat** | 653 kg |
| **Barley** | 653 kg |
| **Dates** | 653 kg |
| **Raisins** | 653 kg |
| **Rice** | 653 kg |

> 💡 The nisab is calculated on the **dried and cleaned** product, not on fresh produce.

## 4. Agricultural Zakat Rate

### 📌 Principle: According to Irrigation Method

| Irrigation Method | Rate | Fraction |
|-------------------|------|----------|
| **Natural** (rain, springs, rivers) | **10%** | العُشر (1/10) |
| **Artificial** (wells, pumps, irrigation) | **5%** | نصف العُشر (1/20) |
| **Mixed** | **7.5%** | According to proportion |

### 📌 Reference Hadith

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"What is irrigated by the sky and springs: one-tenth (10%). What is irrigated by drawing water: half of one-tenth (5%)"** — Al-Bukhari (1483)

### 📋 Calculation Examples

| Situation | Harvest | Irrigation | Rate | Zakat Due |
|-----------|---------|------------|------|-----------|
| Rain-fed wheat field | 1000 kg | Natural | 10% | 100 kg |
| Irrigated olive grove | 2000 kg | Artificial | 5% | 100 kg |
| Mixed orchard | 1500 kg | 50/50 | 7.5% | 112.5 kg |

## 5. Time of Obligation

### 📌 When Does Zakat Become Obligatory?

| School | Timing |
|--------|--------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | When the grain **hardens** or the fruit **ripens** |
| 🟢 Hanafi | At harvest |
| 🔵 Shafi'i | At maturity |
| 🟣 Hanbali | At maturity |

### 📌 Time of Payment

| Stage | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 1 | Grain hardens / fruit ripens |
| 2 | Zakat becomes **obligatory** |
| 3 | Harvest and drying |
| 4 | **Payment** after drying |

---

## 6. Costs and Deductions

### 📊 SCHOOLS' POSITIONS

| School | Are costs deducted from Nisab? |
|--------|--------------------------------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | **No**, costs are not deducted |
| 🟢 Hanafi | No |
| 🔵 Shafi'i | No |
| 🟣 Hanbali | Yes, some costs |

> 💡 **Maliki Position:** Cultivation costs (seeds, plowing, labor) are not deducted. Zakat is calculated on gross harvest, but the reduced rate (5%) already compensates for irrigation costs.

---

## 7. Special Cases

### 📋 Multiple Harvests

| Situation | Maliki Rule |
|-----------|-------------|
| **2 harvests/year of same product** | Each harvest independent |
| **Different products** | Each has its own nisab |
| **Same season, same product** | Combined for nisab |

### 📋 Leased Land (الإجارة)

| Party | Who Pays Zakat? |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Owner** | On rent received (if nisab reached) |
| **Tenant** | On the harvest |

### 📋 Sharecropping (المزارعة/المساقاة)

| Party | Zakat Due |
|-------|-----------|
| **Owner** | On their share of harvest |
| **Sharecropper** | On their share of harvest |

> Each party pays if their share reaches the nisab.
