## Introduction

Vessels (Al-Aniya) are containers used to store water, food, and drink. Islamic law has established important rulings regarding vessels that every Muslim should know.

## The Default Ruling on Vessels

**The default ruling on vessels is permissibility** unless there is evidence indicating prohibition.

Allah says: ﴿It is He who created for you all of that which is on the earth.﴾ [Al-Baqarah: 29].

## Types of Vessels and Their Rulings

### Category One: Permissible Vessels

| Type | Ruling | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Wooden vessels | ✅ Permissible | Default is permissibility |

### Category Two: Gold and Silver Vessels

#### Ruling
**Prohibited** for both men and women for eating and drinking.

#### Evidence

1. Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said: **"Do not wear silk or brocade, and do not drink from gold and silver vessels, and do not eat from their plates, for they are for them (disbelievers) in this world and for you in the Hereafter."** (Agreed upon).

2. Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said: **"The one who drinks from a silver vessel is only gulping the fire of Hell into his belly."** (Agreed upon).

#### Wisdom Behind the Prohibition

1. **Extravagance and waste:** Using them is a waste of wealth.
2. **Pride and arrogance:** It breaks the hearts of the poor.
3. **Resembling the people of Paradise:** They are for them in the Hereafter.

#### What is Treated Like Gold and Silver Vessels

| Case | Ruling |
| :--- | :--- |
| Vessel plated with gold | ❌ Prohibited absolutely |
| Vessel with large silver patch for decoration | ❌ Prohibited |
| Vessel with small silver patch for necessity | ✅ Permissible |

**Evidence:** The Prophet ﷺ drank from a cup that had a silver patch (Narrated by Al-Bukhari).

### Category Three: Vessels of Non-Muslims

#### Ruling
**The default is that they are pure and permissible** unless their impurity is known.

#### Evidence

1. Abu Tha'labah Al-Khushani (may Allah be pleased with him) said: "I said, 'O Messenger of Allah, we are in a land of the People of the Book. Can we eat from their vessels?' He said: **'If you find other than them, do not eat from them. But if you do not find other than them, then wash them and eat from them.'** (Agreed upon).

2. Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) performed Wudu from a Christian woman's jar (Narrated by Al-Bukhari).

#### Details

| Case | Ruling |
| :--- | :--- |
| Vessels whose condition is unknown | ✅ Pure (default is purity) |
| Vessels known to be used for wine or pork | Wash them, then use them |
| Availability of Muslims' vessels | Better to use Muslims' vessels |

---

### Category Four: Skins of Dead Animals

#### Before Tanning
**Impure** and cannot be used.

#### After Tanning
**Pure** and permissible to use according to the correct opinion.

#### Evidence
Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: **"Any skin that is tanned has become pure."** (Narrated by Muslim).

Maymunah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: "A dead sheep was passed by the Prophet ﷺ while people were dragging it. He said: **'Why don't you take its skin?'** They said: 'It is dead!' He said: **'Water and qaraz (acacia leaves) purify it.'**" (Narrated by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i).

#### Exceptions to Tanning

| Type | Ruling After Tanning |
| :--- | :--- |
| Pig skin | ❌ Does not become pure (inherently impure) |
| Dog skin | ❌ Does not become pure according to the correct opinion |
| Human skin | ❌ Cannot be used (due to human dignity) |

### 3. If a Cat Drinks from a Vessel
