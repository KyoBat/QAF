## Friday Prayer (Salat Al-Jumu'ah)

All praise be to Allah who made Friday the best day of the week. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ who said: **"The best day on which the sun rises is Friday."** The Friday prayer is an individual obligation for every Muslim man who is resident.

> Allah تعالى says: **"O you who believe! When the call is proclaimed for the prayer on Friday, hasten to the remembrance of Allah and leave off business"** — Al-Jumu'ah: 9
