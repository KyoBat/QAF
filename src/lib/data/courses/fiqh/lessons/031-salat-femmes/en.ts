## Introduction: Equality Within Difference

<div class="scene-box">

**The Foundational Principle**

*In Islam, a woman is obligated to perform the same prayers as a man.*

*Five daily prayers. The same pillars. The same conditions.*

*However, due to her physical nature and certain states specific to her, the Fiqh has granted her accommodations and adaptations.*

*These rulings are not restrictions but merciful dispensations from Allah.*

</div>

> **The Principle:** "Women are the twin halves of men" — Women share the same rulings as men unless there is specific evidence indicating otherwise.

---

## Foundational Texts

### From the Quran

> **"Establish prayer, give zakah, and obey Allah and His Messenger."**
> — [Al-Ahzab: 33]

### From the Prophetic Sunnah

> Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) reported:
> **"The Messenger of Allah would pray Fajr, and believing women would attend wrapped in their garments."**
> — Bukhari (372), Muslim (645)

## Chapter 1: Dress and Awrah (What Must Be Covered)

### What a Woman Must Cover

<div class="scene-box">

**The Verse of Covering**

*Allah says:*

**"And let them draw their head-coverings over their chests."**
— [An-Nur: 31]

</div>

#### The Four Schools on Women's Awrah in Prayer

| School | What Must Be Covered | Exception |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Maliki** | Entire body except face and hands | Feet exempt according to some |
| **Hanafi** | Entire body except face, hands, and feet | |
| **Shafi'i** | Entire body except face and hands | Even when alone |
| **Hanbali** | Entire body except face | Hands: two opinions |

> **Note:** The awrah for prayer is not identical to the awrah regarding gaze. Prayer has its own specific rulings.

#### Elements of Dress

| Element | Required? | Evidence |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Head covering (hair)** | Yes — consensus | Hadith of Umm Salama |
| **Neck covering** | Yes | Part of awrah |
| **Arm covering** | Yes | To the wrists |
| **Leg covering** | Yes | To the ankles |
| **Top of feet** | School-dependent | Maliki/Hanafi: not required |

#### Hadith of Umm Salama

> Umm Salama asked the Prophet:
> **"Can a woman pray in a shift and head-cover without a lower garment?"**
> **He said: "If the shift is ample, covering the tops of her feet."**

**Source:** Abu Dawud (640)

## Chapter 2: Differences in Posture

### Is There a Difference Between Men and Women?

<div class="scene-box">

**Two Scholarly Approaches**

*Scholars have differed:*

**First View (Hanafis, some Hanbalis):**
The woman should compress herself in prayer — elbows tucked in, prostration compact.

**Second View (Malikis, Shafi'is, preferred Hanbali view):**
There is no difference. A woman prays exactly like a man.

*Imam Malik said:*
**"I do not know any difference between a man and a woman in that regard."**

</div>

#### Comparative Table of Postures

| Posture | Maliki | Hanafi | Shafi'i | Hanbali |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| **Raising hands** | Like men | To shoulders (not ears) | Like men | Like men |
| **Position of arms** | Like men | Pressed against sides | Like men | Two views |
| **Bowing (ruku)** | Like men | Less pronounced | Like men | Like men |
| **Prostration (sujud)** | Like men | Compact, belly on thighs | Like men | Two views |
| **Sitting (tashahhud)** | Like men | Legs towards right | Like men | Legs towards right |

> **The Preferred View:** The hadiths mentioning differences in posture for women are weak. The hadith "Pray as you have seen me praying" includes both men and women.

## Chapter 3: Place of Prayer

### At the Mosque or at Home?

<div class="scene-box">

**Hadith of the Home**

*The Prophet said:*

**"Do not prevent your women from going to the mosques, but their homes are better for them."**

</div>

**Source:** Abu Dawud (567), Ahmad

#### Summary of Rulings

| Issue | Ruling |
|-------|--------|
| **Forbidding a woman from the mosque?** | Haram — explicit text |
| **Her prayer at home is better?** | Yes, according to the majority |
| **Does she attend Jumu'ah?** | Permissible, but not obligatory for her |
| **Conditions for going to mosque** | Modest dress, no perfume, husband's permission |

## Chapter 4: Menstruation (Hayd) and Postpartum Bleeding (Nifas)

### Prayer Is Forbidden

<div class="scene-box">

**The Clear Ruling**

*The Prophet said to Fatima bint Abi Hubaysh:*

**"When menstruation begins, leave the prayer."**

</div>

**Source:** Bukhari (306), Muslim (333)

#### Essential Rulings

| Ruling | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Prayer is forbidden** | Throughout hayd and nifas |

| **Touching the Mushaf** | Forbidden according to majority (Malikis permit for learning) |
| **Entering the mosque** | Forbidden according to majority (Malikis: if passing through) |

#### Duration of Menstruation by School

| School | Minimum | Maximum | Average |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Maliki** | No limit | 15 days | Variable |

## Chapter 5: Istihadah (Irregular Bleeding)

### Bleeding Outside of Menses

<div class="scene-box">

**Hadith of Fatima bint Abi Hubaysh**

*She came to the Prophet:*

**"O Messenger of Allah, I have continuous bleeding and never become pure. Should I abandon the prayer?"**

**The Prophet:** "No! That is only a vein. Make wudu for each prayer and pray."

</div>

**Source:** Bukhari (228), Muslim (333)

#### Rulings of Istihadah

| **Sanitary protection** | Recommended |
| **Marital relations** | Permissible according to majority |

## Chapter 6: Pregnancy and Nursing

### Accommodations Granted

<div class="scene-box">

**The Mercy of Fiqh**

*A pregnant or nursing woman may benefit from accommodations:*

- Pray sitting if standing is difficult
- Shorten the recitation if exhausted
- Lean on a support during prayer

*The principle: "No harm and no reciprocal harm."*

</div>

#### Permissible Adaptations

| Situation | Adaptation |
|-----------|------------|
| **Severe fatigue** | Pray sitting |
| **Nausea** | Interrupt if necessary, repeat afterward |
| **Light incontinence** | Like mustahada: wudu for each prayer |
| **Baby crying** | Shorten the prayer (for the imam) |

> **Hadith:** The Prophet said: "I enter prayer intending to lengthen it, then I hear a baby crying, so I shorten my prayer knowing how intensely his mother feels about his crying." — Bukhari (707)

</div>

**Source:** Muslim (440)

#### Order of Rows

| Group | Position |
|-------|----------|
| **Men** | Front |
| **Children (boys)** | Behind men |
| **Women** | Behind children |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I pray with nail polish?

**Answer:** Regular nail polish prevents water from reaching the nails. Wudu becomes invalid.

**Solutions:**
- Breathable nail polish — debate over its actual permeability
- Remove it before making wudu

### Can I pray with makeup?

**Answer:** Permissible if:
- It does not contain impure substances
- It does not prevent water from reaching the skin
- You do not go out adorned before non-mahram men

### What if hair becomes exposed during prayer?

**Answer:** If a strand appears momentarily and is immediately covered, the prayer is valid. If a significant portion shows for an extended time, some scholars say the prayer should be repeated.

## Closing Supplication

> **"O Allah, make us among those who pray with khushu, and accept our prayers, our fasting, and all our deeds."**

---

**May Allah accept from us and from you**

*The rulings of Fiqh for women are not burdens but facilitations that testify to the mercy of the Wise Legislator.*
