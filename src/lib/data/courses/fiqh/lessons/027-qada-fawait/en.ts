## 📖 Making Up Missed Prayers (Qada' Al-Fawait)

All praise be to Allah who prescribed prayer at fixed times. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. A Muslim must perform prayers on time, but if one is missed, it must be made up.

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Whoever forgets a prayer or sleeps through it, its expiation is to pray it when he remembers"** — Al-Bukhari (597)

## 🎯 4. Special Cases

### 📌 Deliberately abandoned prayer

| School | Must it be made up? |
|--------|---------------------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | ✅ **Yes** — sin doesn't exempt from makeup |
| 🟢 Hanafi | ✅ Yes |
| 🔵 Shafi'i | ✅ Yes |
| 🟣 Hanbali | ⚠️ Opinion: deliberately abandoned prayer cannot be made up (minority view) |

### 📌 Woman and menstruation
