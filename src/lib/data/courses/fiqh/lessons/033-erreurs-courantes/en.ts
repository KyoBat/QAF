## Introduction: The Importance of Correction

<div class="scene-box">

**The Hadith of the Man Who Prayed Badly**

*A man entered the mosque and prayed. Then he came to greet the Prophet ﷺ.*

*The Prophet ﷺ said: "Go back and pray, for you have not prayed."*

*The man returned, prayed, then came back. The Prophet ﷺ repeated: "Go back and pray, for you have not prayed."*

*This happened three times. The man said: "By the One who sent you with the truth, I do not know how to do better. Teach me!"*

*Then the Prophet ﷺ taught him the correct prayer.*

</div>

> **Lesson:** Many pray without knowing they commit invalidating errors. This lesson aims to correct the most frequent mistakes.

## Chapter 1: Mistakes in Recitation

### Mistake #1: Not Reciting al-Fātiḥa Correctly

<div class="scene-box">

**The Fatal Error**

*Al-Fātiḥa is a pillar. Without it, the prayer is invalid.*

*The Prophet ﷺ said:*

**"There is no prayer for one who does not recite al-Fātiḥa."**

</div>

**Source:** al-Bukhārī (756), Muslim (394)

#### Common Errors in al-Fātiḥa

| Error | Consequence | Correction |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **Omitting a letter** | May invalidate depending on the letter | Review with a teacher |
| **Mispronouncing ḍād** | Changes the meaning | Learn basic tajwīd |
| **Saying "ṣirāṭ" instead of "aṣ-ṣirāṭ"** | Omits the definite article | Properly pronounce "aṣ-ṣirāṭ" |
| **Not saying "āmīn"** | Misses a confirmed sunna | Say "āmīn" after al-Fātiḥa |
| **Reciting too fast** | Letters get swallowed | Slow down, articulate |

### Mistake #2: Omitting the Opening Takbīr

| Situation | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Forgetting "Allāhu Akbar"** | Prayer INVALID — it's a pillar |
| **Saying it mentally without speaking** | INVALID — must be pronounced |
| **Saying it before the imam** | INVALID — must be after him |

### Mistake #3: Reciting Aloud/Quietly at Wrong Times

| Prayer | Recitation |
|--------|------------|
| **Fajr, Maghrib, 'Ishā'** | Fātiḥa and sūra aloud (jahr) |
| **Ẓuhr, 'Aṣr** | Fātiḥa and sūra quietly (sirr) |
| **Imam who reverses** | Prayer valid but makrūh |

## Chapter 2: Mistakes in Posture

### Mistake #4: Not Achieving Ṭuma'nīna (Tranquility)

<div class="scene-box">

**The Fatal Rush**

*Ṭuma'nīna (tranquility) is a PILLAR of prayer.*

*The Prophet ﷺ told the man who prayed badly:*

**"Then bow until you attain tranquility while bowing, then rise until you stand upright."**

</div>

#### Signs of Lacking Ṭuma'nīna

| Sign | Problem |
|------|---------|
| **Pecking** | Sujūd too quick, like a bird |
| **No pause between positions** | Going directly from rukū' to sujūd |
| **Going down before the imam** | Anticipating instead of following |
| **Less than 3 seconds in position** | Minimum for tranquility |

> **Rule:** Each position must last long enough to say "subḥāna rabbiya l-'aẓīm" at least once.

### Mistake #5: Incorrect Rukū'

| Error | Description | Correction |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **Arched back** | Back curved instead of flat | Back straight, parallel to ground |
| **Head raised** | Looking forward | Head aligned with back |
| **Knees bent** | Legs flexed | Legs straight |
| **Hands on thighs** | Not on knees | Hands gripping the knees |

### Mistake #6: Incorrect Sujūd

| Error | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| **Nose not on ground** | Invalid according to some — 7 limbs must touch |
| **Elbows on ground** | Makrūh — "don't spread like a dog" |
| **Feet lifted** | Loses a limb of prostration |
| **Buttocks higher than head** | Incorrect position |

> **The 7 limbs:** Forehead + nose, 2 hands, 2 knees, 2 feet (toes).

## Chapter 3: Masbūq (Late-Comer) Mistakes

### Mistake #7: Not Knowing When You've "Caught" the Rak'a

<div class="scene-box">

**The Golden Rule**

*The Prophet ﷺ said:*

**"Whoever catches the rukū' has caught the rak'a."**

</div>

**Source:** Abū Dāwūd (893), an-Nasā'ī — *Classified as ḍaʿīf by al-Albānī, but accepted by other scholars based on the practice of the Salaf and supporting chains.*

| Situation | Rak'a Counted? |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Join imam in rukū'** | YES — rak'a validated |
| **Join after rukū'** | NO — must make up |
| **Join during sujūd** | NO — rak'a not counted |

### Mistake #8: Wrong Make-Up Method

| School | What the Masbūq Makes Up |
|--------|--------------------------|
| **Maliki** | What he missed = BEGINNING of his prayer (completes the end) |
| **Hanafi** | What he missed = END of his prayer (caught the beginning) |
| **Shafi'i** | What he missed = END (like Hanafi) |
| **Hanbali** | What he missed = END (like Hanafi) |

> **Maliki Example:** You miss 2 rak'at of Ẓuhr. After the imam's salām, you do 2 rak'at with Fātiḥa + sūra (that's your "beginning").

---

## Chapter 4: Tashahhud Mistakes

### Mistake #9: Wrong Finger Position

| Element | Correct Position |
|---------|------------------|
| **Right hand** | Fist closed, index raised |
| **Index finger** | Pointing toward qibla, slightly moving or fixed |
| **Left hand** | On left thigh, fingers extended |
| **Common error** | Moving all fingers, not just the index |

### Mistake #10: Forgetting Ṣalawāt on the Prophet ﷺ

| Moment | Status of Ṣalawāt |
|--------|-------------------|
| **First tashahhud** | Sunna (not obligatory) |
| **Last tashahhud** | OBLIGATORY according to Shafi'is and Hanbalis |

> **Maliki/Hanafi Position:** Confirmed sunna in last tashahhud, but prayer remains valid without it.

## Chapter 5: Wuḍū' Errors Affecting Prayer

### Mistake #11: Praying with Invalid Wuḍū'

| Forgotten Nullifiers | Consequence |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Deep sleep** | Wuḍū' nullified — prayer invalid |
| **Touching private parts** | Wuḍū' nullified (majority) |
| **Eating camel meat** | Wuḍū' nullified (Hanbalis) |
| **Bleeding** | Wuḍū' nullified (Hanafis only) |

### Mistake #12: Forgetting a Limb of Wuḍū'

| Forgotten Limb | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| **One foot** | Wuḍū' invalid — prayer invalid |
| **Part of face** | Wuḍū' invalid |
| **Wiping the head** | Wuḍū' invalid |

> **Advice:** Make wuḍū' with concentration, not on autopilot.

---

## Chapter 6: Direction (Qibla) Errors

### Mistake #13: Praying in the Wrong Direction

| Situation | Ruling |
|-----------|--------|
| **Error through ignorance, discovered after** | Prayer VALID (majority) |
| **Error through negligence** | Prayer must be REPEATED |
| **Slight deviation** | Tolerated — qibla is a direction, not a point |
| **Back to qibla** | Prayer INVALID |

> **Hadith:** "What is between east and west is qibla." — at-Tirmidhī (342) — For Medina's inhabitants.

---

## Chapter 7: Concentration Errors

### Mistake #14: Wandering Gaze

<div class="scene-box">

**The Theft of Shayṭān**

*The Prophet ﷺ said:*

**"That is a snatching that Shayṭān steals from the servant's prayer."**

</div>

**Source:** al-Bukhārī (751)

| Direction of Gaze | Ruling |
|-------------------|--------|
| **Place of prostration** | SUNNA — preserves khushū' |
| **Raising eyes to sky** | FORBIDDEN (ḥarām) — Muslim (428): severe threat |
| **Looking right/left** | Makrūh — distraction |

### Mistake #15: Thinking About Other Things

| Level of Distraction | Effect |
|----------------------|--------|
| **Passing thoughts** | No effect on validity |
| **Total distraction** | Prayer valid but no reward |
| **Don't know how many rak'at** | Take the certain number + sujūd sahw |

## Chapter 8: Congregational Prayer Mistakes

### Mistake #16: Preceding the Imam

<div class="scene-box">

**Severe Warning**

*The Prophet ﷺ said:*

**"Does one of you not fear, if he raises his head before the imam, that Allah will transform his head into a donkey's head?"**

</div>

**Source:** al-Bukhārī (691), Muslim (427)

| Action | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Starting before imam** | Invalid (Ḥanbali) / Makrūh taḥrīmī (others) |
| **Rising before him** | Severely makrūh, even ḥarām |
| **Finishing salām before him** | Makrūh |

### Mistake #17: Disorderly Rows

| Problem | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| **Gaps in row** | Fill them — Shayṭān enters there |
| **Rows not aligned** | Align by heels, not toes |
| **Praying alone behind row** | FORBIDDEN — invalid according to some |
