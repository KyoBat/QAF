## 📖 Introduction

All praise is due to Allah who made prayer a source of joy for the believers. May peace and blessings be upon the imam of those who pray, Muhammad son of Abdullah, upon his family, companions, and those who follow them in excellence until the Day of Judgment.

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"The coolness of my eyes has been placed in prayer"** — Reported by An-Nasa'i

This series constitutes the first lessons on the **fiqh of prayer**. We lay here a solid foundation for understanding the greatest physical act of worship in Islam, an act of worship that is a connection between the servant and his Lord five times a day and night.

## 🎓 Why is prayer the pillar of the religion?

| Aspect of Importance | Religious Proof | Impact on the Servant |
|---------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Second pillar of Islam** | The Prophet ﷺ said: "Islam is built upon five pillars... and the establishment of prayer" — Agreed upon | Islam cannot stand without established prayer |
| **First thing judged on the Day of Judgment** | The Prophet ﷺ said: "The first thing the servant will be judged for on the Day of Resurrection is the prayer" — Reported by At-Tirmidhi | Its validity is a sign of the validity of all deeds |
| **Connection between servant and Lord** | Allah تعالى says: **﴾ And establish prayer for My remembrance ﴿** (Ta-Ha: 14) | It fills the heart with Allah's presence and tranquility |
| **Protection from immorality** | Allah تعالى says: **﴾ Indeed, prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing ﴿** (Al-Ankabut: 45) | It purifies character and behavior |

## ⚠️ The punishment for abandoning prayer and the danger of neglecting it

- **Severe Quranic warning:** Allah تعالى says: **﴾ Then there came after them successors who neglected prayer and followed desires; so they will meet Ghayy (perdition) ﴿** (Maryam: 59).
- **Prophetic warning:** The Prophet ﷺ said: **"The covenant between us and them is the prayer; whoever abandons it has disbelieved"** — Reported by Ahmad and the authors of the Sunan.
- **Consensus of the Salaf on its gravity:** Imam Ibn Hanbal said: *"Whoever deliberately abandons prayer until its time passes has disbelieved"* — Reported by Ibn al-Qayyim.

> ⚠️ **Educational reminder:** Abandoning prayer is not merely a "sin", it is cutting the rope that connects the servant to his Lord, and a cause of immense deprivation in this world and the Hereafter.

## 🔷 Tranquility (Tuma'nina) and Humility (Khushu') in Prayer — A Pillar and a Soul

### Tranquility is a pillar without which prayer is invalid

Tranquility is remaining still in each pillar of prayer for the time necessary for the worshipper to be settled. It is a pillar according to the majority of scholars. Among the most important proofs of its obligation:

#### 1. The hadith of the one who prayed badly (fundamental principle)

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 The man who didn't pray three times!**

*A man entered the mosque while the Prophet ﷺ was sitting with his companions...*

*The man prayed quickly, then came to greet the Prophet ﷺ.*

**The Prophet ﷺ:** "Go back and pray, for you have not prayed"

*The man returned and prayed the same way... then came back to greet.*

**The Prophet ﷺ:** "Go back and pray, for you have not prayed"

*This happened **three times**!*

**The man:** *[confused and humble]* "By the One who sent you with the truth, I do not know how to do better, teach me!"

**The Prophet ﷺ:** *[with gentleness and patience]* "When you stand for prayer, say the takbir, then recite what is easy for you from the Quran, then bow until you are tranquil in your bowing, then rise until you stand upright, then prostrate until you are tranquil in your prostration, then rise until you are tranquil sitting, and do this throughout your prayer"

</div>

**📍 Narrator:** Abu Hurayra رضي الله عنه — Agreed upon (Al-Bukhari 757, Muslim 397)

> 📌 **Lesson from the scene:** The expression "until you are tranquil" in each pillar proves that tranquility is a pillar, and abandoning it invalidates the prayer.

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 The worst theft!**

*The Prophet ﷺ was warning his companions about a grave evil...*

**The Prophet ﷺ:** "The worst thief is the one who steals from his prayer"

**The Companions:** *[surprised]* "O Messenger of Allah, how does he steal from his prayer?"

**The Prophet ﷺ:** "He does not complete his bowing or prostration"

</div>

**📚 Source:** Reported by Ahmad and Ad-Darimi — ✅ Authenticated by Al-Albani

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"The prayer is not accepted if the man does not straighten his back in bowing and prostration"** — Reported by Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi, authenticated.

#### 3. The warning against not straightening up

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Allah does not look at the prayer of a man who does not straighten his back between his bowing and prostration"** — Reported by Ahmad, authenticated by Al-Albani.

### Humility (Khushu'): the soul and essence of prayer

#### Quranic proofs on humility

| Verse | Surah | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **﴾ Successful indeed are the believers, those who are humble in their prayers ﴿** | Al-Mu'minun: 1-2 | Humility is a sign of success and the first quality of believers |
| **﴾ Seek help through patience and prayer; indeed it is difficult except for the humble ﴿** | Al-Baqara: 45 | Prayer is heavy except for those whose hearts are humble |
| **﴾ Has the time not come for those who believe that their hearts should be humbled at the remembrance of Allah ﴿** | Al-Hadid: 16 | Divine reproach to those who delay in humility |
| **﴾ And stand before Allah devoutly ﴿** | Al-Baqara: 238 | Qunut: calmness and submission in prayer |

#### Proofs from the Sunnah on humility

- The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Any Muslim who performs ablution well, then stands to pray two rak'at being fully present in heart and face, Paradise is guaranteed for him"** — Reported by Muslim.

- The Prophet ﷺ said: **"The servant prays and only a tenth is recorded for him, a ninth, an eighth, a seventh, a sixth, a fifth, a quarter, a third, half"** — Reported by Abu Dawud, authenticated by Al-Albani.

> 📌 **Benefit:** The reward of prayer depends on humility and presence of heart. One who prays with his body only loses most of the reward.

### How to achieve tranquility and humility?

| Means | Practical Application |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Remember Allah's greatness** | Remember that you are standing before the King of kings |
| **Reflect on what you recite** | Understand the meanings of Al-Fatiha and the surahs |
| **Prolong bowing and prostration** | Don't rush, give each pillar its share of remembrance |
| **Look at the place of prostration** | Prevents wandering of sight and heart |
| **Repel whispers** | Seek refuge from Satan and focus on meanings |
| **Pray at the beginning of the time** | Before the mind is occupied with worldly matters |

- It is reported: **"Prayer attracts provision, preserves blessings, and repels misfortunes."**
- One who frequents the mosque for the five prayers, Allah preserves his family and wealth.

### 3. Light for the believer on the Day of Judgment
