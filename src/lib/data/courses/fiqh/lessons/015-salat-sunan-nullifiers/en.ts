## The Sunan of Prayer and Its Nullifiers

All praise be to Allah who legislated prayer for us in the most perfect manner. May peace and blessings be upon the one who clarified its sunan and its warnings. After learning the pillars and obligations, today we learn about the **sunan** which beautify the prayer and increase khushu' (humility), and the **nullifiers** which must be avoided.

## First: The Sunan of Prayer

### 1. Confirmed Verbal and Practical Sunan (Sunan Mu'akkadah)

| Sunnah | Proof or Trace | Practical Benefits |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Raising the hands with the four takbirs (opening, bowing, rising from it, after standing from the first tashahhud) | Hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to raise his hands level with his shoulders when he opened the prayer..." — Al-Bukhari (735) | Helps with presence of heart and shows following of the Sunnah |
| Placing the right hand over the left on the chest | Hadith of Wa'il ibn Hujr — An-Nasa'i (889) | Symbolizes humility and discipline |
| The opening supplication | "Allahumma ba'id bayni wa bayna khatayaya..." — Agreed upon | Prepares the heart to enter the prayer |
| Seeking refuge (isti'adha) and basmala before Al-Fatiha | The Most High says: **﴿ When you recite the Quran, seek refuge in Allah ﴿** (An-Nahl: 98) | Invoking refuge repels whispers |
| Reciting a surah after Al-Fatiha in the first two rak'at | Mutawatir practice of the Prophet ﷺ | Nourishes the soul with varied verses |
| Saying "Amin" after Al-Fatiha | Hadith of Abu Hurayra: "When the imam says 'nor of those who went astray,' say Amin..." — Al-Bukhari (782) | A cause for forgiveness of sins if it coincides with the angels' Amin |
| Reciting silently where appropriate and aloud where appropriate | His sunnah ﷺ in the audible and silent prayers | Achieves the legislated balance |
| Multiplying supplications in prostration | "The closest a servant is to his Lord is when he is prostrating" — Muslim (482) | Time of acceptance |

### 2. Non-confirmed but Recommended Sunan (complete the dignity)

- Sitting briefly to rest after the second prostration in the odd rak'a (hadith of Malik ibn al-Huwayrith — Al-Bukhari 823).
- Saying tasbih more than once in bowing and prostration.
- Lengthening the first rak'a over the second, and Fajr over the other prayers.
- Praying the nafl before and after the obligatory (the rawatib) to support khushu'.

> **Educational Note:** Leaving the sunan does not invalidate the prayer but deprives the worshipper of the perfection of reward, and it also maintains the warmth of faith.

## Second: The Nullifiers of Prayer

### 1. Major Nullifiers (invalidate the prayer immediately)

| Nullifier | Proof | Examples |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Deliberately omitting a pillar or condition | Mentioned previously | Not prostrating, or making takbir without intention |
| Laughing out loud and speaking for other than the prayer's benefit | Hadith of Zayd ibn Arqam: "This prayer is not suitable for people's speech" — Muslim (537) | Loud laughter |
| Eating and drinking deliberately | Consensus of scholars | Even if a small amount |
| Flagrant exposure of the 'awra | Covering the 'awra is a condition | Torn clothing without covering |
| Minor or major hadath (ritual impurity) | The Prophet's ﷺ statement: "Prayer is not accepted without purification" — Muslim | Passing wind, or breaking wudu |

### 2. Minor Nullifiers (contrary to khushu' and to be avoided)

- Excessive continuous movement without necessity.
- Continuously turning with the head or body.
- Playing with the phone or clothing.
- Raising the gaze to the sky (the Prophet ﷺ prohibited this — Al-Bukhari 750).
- Supplicating for forbidden worldly matters.

> **Rule:** What corrupts khushu' may not invalidate the prayer but diminishes the reward, so let the worshipper be cautious.

## Practical Tips for Preserving the Sunan and Avoiding Nullifiers

1. **Prepare the heart before prayer:** Sit for a minute to reflect on the greatness of standing before Allah.
2. **Prepare the place:** Appropriate lighting, clean prayer mat, remove distractions.
3. **Straighten the rows:** Especially in congregation, this helps with tranquility.
4. **Lower the gaze and voice:** Helps with presence of heart.
5. **Commit to dhikr after prayer:** It completes the deficiency that occurred in the sunan.

  - Minor nullifiers: excessive movement, turning, distraction.
