## 🔥 Abu Lahab's Response — Eternal Damnation

>
> **"May you perish for the rest of the day! Is this what you gathered us for?!"**

---

### 📜 The Divine Response — Surah Al-Masad

> The response came down from heaven, swift and decisive:

>
> — **[Surah Al-Masad]**

---

### 💡 Remarkable Reflection

| Observation | Significance |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Open challenge** | If Abu Lahab had accepted Islam — even hypocritically — he would have invalidated the Quran! |
| **The result** | He died in disbelief, confirming the divine promise |
| **The miracle** | This is one of the prophetic miracles of the Quran |

---

## ⚔️ Quraysh's Strategies — Total Confrontation

### 1️⃣ Defamation and Mockery

| Accusation | Quranic Response |
|------------|------------------|
| **Magician** | ﴿The disbelievers said, "This is a lying magician"﴾ |
| **Madman** | ﴿Your companion is not possessed﴾ |
| **Poet** | ﴿It is not the word of a poet﴾ |
| **Soothsayer** | ﴿Nor the word of a soothsayer﴾ |
| **Ancient legends** | ﴿They said, "Tales of the ancients which he has written down"﴾ |
| **A human teaches him** | ﴿The tongue of the one they refer to is foreign﴾ |

---

### 2️⃣ Pressure on Abu Talib

> The leaders of Quraysh went to **Abu Talib** repeatedly...

---

#### 🎭 The First Delegation

> **Quraysh**: O Abu Talib! Your nephew has insulted our gods, criticized our religion, called our ancestors fools, and led our fathers astray.
>
> Either you make him stop, or you let us deal with him!
>
> **Abu Talib**: He responded with gentle words... and they left.

---

#### 🎭 The Second Delegation — The Threat

> They returned with a firmer delegation:
>
> **Quraysh**: O Abu Talib! You have age, honor, and rank among us.
>
> We asked you to make your nephew stop but you haven't!
>
> **By Allah, we will not tolerate this anymore until you make him stop, or we will fight both you and him until one of the two sides perishes!**

---

#### 🎭 The Scene of Confrontation — The Sun and the Moon

> The matter became heavy for Abu Talib...
>
> He sent for Muhammad ﷺ and said:
>
> *"O son of my brother! Your people have come to me and said such and such..."*
>
> *"Spare me and spare yourself, and do not burden me with what I cannot bear!"*
>
> The Prophet ﷺ thought his uncle had abandoned him...
>
> So he spoke these **immortal** words:

> **"O my uncle! By Allah, if they put the sun in my right hand and the moon in my left hand to make me abandon this matter until Allah makes it prevail or I perish in its defense, I would not abandon it!"**

> Then he **wept** ﷺ and rose to leave...
>
> Abu Talib called out to him:
>
> *"Come back, son of my brother!"*
>
> When he returned, he said:
>
> **"Go, son of my brother, and say whatever you wish. By Allah, I will never hand you over to anything!"**

---

### 3️⃣ Negotiation and Temptation

> When pressure failed... Quraysh resorted to **temptation**:

---

#### 🎭 The Scene of 'Utba ibn Rabi'a

> **The place**: Near the Kaaba...
>
> 'Utba ibn Rabi'a — one of the wise men of Quraysh — sits before the Prophet ﷺ:

> **'Utba**: O son of my brother! You are one of us, of the best lineage and highest rank.
>
> But you have brought to your people a grave matter that has divided their community...
>
> Listen to me, I will offer you things:
>
> - **If you want wealth** — we will gather for you from our wealth until you are the richest among us
> - **If you want honor** — we will make you our chief and decide nothing without you
> - **If you want kingship** — we will make you king over us
> - **If what comes to you is a spirit of jinn** — we will seek a physician for you and spend our wealth to cure you

> The Prophet ﷺ remained silent until 'Utba finished, then he said:
>
> **"Have you finished, Abu al-Walid?"**
>
> He said: Yes.
>
> **"Then listen to me."**

> Then he recited:
>
> **﴿ Ha Mim. A revelation from the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. A Book whose verses have been detailed, an Arabic Quran for people who know... ﴾**
>
> — **[Fussilat: 1-3]**

> He continued reciting until he reached the verse of prostration, then he prostrated ﷺ.
>
> 'Utba stood **amazed**...
>
> Having placed his hands behind his back leaning on them...
>
> Listening with his whole being!

---

#### 💬 'Utba's Testimony

> 'Utba returned to Quraysh with a changed expression...
>
> **Quraysh**: What happened, Abu al-Walid?
>
> **'Utba**: By Allah, I have heard words the like of which I have never heard!
>
> By Allah, it is not poetry, nor magic, nor soothsaying!
>
> **O people of Quraysh, obey me and consider this my affair. Leave this man alone!**
>
> **By Allah, these words that I have heard will have great consequence!**
>
> **Quraysh** (mockingly): He has bewitched you with his tongue, Abu al-Walid!

| **Kingship** — We will make you king | "Nor honor among you nor kingship over you" |
| **Treatment** — We will cure you of the jinn | "Allah has sent me as a messenger" |
