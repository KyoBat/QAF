## 🎬 Introduction

### The Beginning of the Great Trial

After the public proclamation on Mount Safa...

Quraysh realized that this religion **would not stop** through mockery and threats...

They moved to **a new phase**: physical torture!

They targeted **the weak** among the Muslims:

- The poor without clans
- Women and children

**Why the weak?** Because no one protects them... no tribe will avenge them!
