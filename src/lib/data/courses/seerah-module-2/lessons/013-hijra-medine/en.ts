# 🕌 The Hijra to Medina — The Beginning of a New Era

> **﴿ If you do not help him, Allah has already helped him when those who disbelieved expelled him, the second of two. When they were in the cave, he said to his companion: "Do not grieve, for Allah is with us." Then Allah sent down His tranquility upon him and supported him with soldiers you did not see ﴾**
> — **Surah At-Tawba, verse 40**

---

## 📍 Prelude — Preparing for the Hijra

After thirteen years of preaching in Mecca, after Al-Isra wal-Mi'raj, a new phase was beginning. Medina (Yathrib) awaited the light coming from Mecca.

## 🤝 The First Pledge of Aqaba (621)

### The First Meeting

During the pilgrimage season, the Prophet ﷺ met six men from the Khazraj tribe of Yathrib:

> 📜 **The Scene**:
>
> The Prophet ﷺ sat with these men at Al-Aqaba. They listened to his words, and he recited Quran to them. They looked at each other and said:
>
> *"By Allah, this is the prophet the Jews have been threatening us with! Let us not let them get to him before us!"*
>
> They believed in him and returned to Yathrib as preachers of Islam.

---

### The First Pledge of Aqaba (12 men)

The following year, twelve men from Yathrib came and pledged allegiance to the Prophet ﷺ on:

| Article | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Not to associate anything with Allah** | Pure monotheism |
| **Not to steal** | Protection of property |
| **Not to commit adultery** | Protection of honor |
| **Not to kill our children** | Prohibition of infanticide |
| **Not to slander** | Prohibition of lying |
| **Not to disobey in what is good** | Obedience in virtue |

> 💬 This is called **"the Pledge of Women"** because it did not include fighting.

The Prophet ﷺ sent with them **Mus'ab ibn 'Umayr** to teach them Islam — the first ambassador of Islam!

---

## 🤝 The Second Pledge of Aqaba (622)

### The Great Delegation

The following year, a huge delegation came from Yathrib:

| **2 women** | Nusayba bint Ka'b and Asma bint 'Amr |
| **Location** | Al-Aqaba, at night, in secret |
| **Time** | The days of Tashriq |

---

### The Content of the Pledge

> 📜 **The Scene**:
>
> In the darkness of night, the Ansar crept to Al-Aqaba. The Prophet ﷺ came accompanied by his uncle Al-Abbas (who was not yet Muslim but wanted to protect his nephew).
>
> Al-Abbas said: *"O assembly of Khazraj! Muhammad is from us as you know, and we have protected him from his people. He enjoys honor among his people and protection in his land. Yet he has insisted on joining you. If you think you can fulfill your promises to him and protect him from his adversaries, then assume what you have taken upon yourselves. But if you think you will surrender him and abandon him after he comes to you, then leave him now!"*

**Al-Bara ibn Ma'rur** — the eldest among them — stood and said:

> *"Accept our pledge, O Messenger of Allah! By Allah, we are people of war and people of arms, we inherited this from generation to generation!"*

---

### The Conditions of the Pledge

They pledged allegiance to the Prophet ﷺ on:

| Condition | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|

| **Spending** | In hardship and ease |
| **Enjoining good and forbidding evil** | Constant preaching |
| **Standing for Allah** | Without fearing anyone's blame |
| **Supporting the Prophet ﷺ** | As they defend their women and children |

> 💬 The Prophet ﷺ said: *"I give you my pledge that you will protect me as you protect your women and children"*
>
> Al-Bara took his hand and said: *"Yes! By the One who sent you with truth as a prophet, we will protect you as we protect our families! Accept our pledge, O Messenger of Allah, we are sons of war!"*

---

### The Twelve Representatives

The Prophet ﷺ chose twelve representatives — guarantors for their people:

| From Khazraj (9) | From Aws (3) |
|------------------|--------------|
| As'ad ibn Zurara | Usayd ibn Hudayr |
| Sa'd ibn ar-Rabi' | Sa'd ibn Khaythama |

---

## 🚶 The Beginning of the Hijra

### Permission to Migrate

After the pledge, the Prophet ﷺ permitted the Muslims to migrate to Medina:

> 💬 He ﷺ said: *"I have been shown your land of emigration: a land of palm trees between two volcanic tracts"* — the two Harras (black basaltic lands)

The Muslims began leaving secretly, individually and in groups, leaving behind their homes and wealth.

---

### The First Emigrants

| Companion | His Story |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Abu Salama** | The first to emigrate, separated from his wife and son |
| **Suhayb ar-Rumi** | Left all his wealth to Quraysh to be allowed to leave |
| **'Umar ibn al-Khattab** | Emigrated openly, defying Quraysh |
| **'Ayyash ibn Abi Rabi'a** | Was deceived and brought back to Mecca in chains |

> 📜 **Suhayb's Story**:
>
> When Suhayb wanted to emigrate, Quraysh said to him: *"You came to us poor and insignificant, your wealth grew among us, you reached what you reached, and now you want to leave with your wealth and your life?! By Allah, that will not happen!"*
>
> Suhayb said: *"What if I gave you my wealth, would you let me go?"*
>
> They said: *"Yes!"*
>
> He told them where all his wealth was hidden and left.
>
> When the news reached the Prophet ﷺ, he said: *"Suhayb has profited! Suhayb has profited!"*

---

## 🗡️ Quraysh's Plot to Kill the Prophet ﷺ

### The Meeting at Dar an-Nadwa

When Quraysh saw that the Muslims were emigrating, they feared that Muhammad ﷺ would join them and become stronger. They gathered at **Dar an-Nadwa** to deliberate:

> 📜 **The Scene**:
>
> The chiefs of Quraysh sat to discuss:
>
> — **One of them**: Let us imprison him in a house and seal the exits until he dies!
> — **Iblis** (in the form of an elderly man from Najd): No! His companions will come and free him!
>
> — **Another**: Let us expel him from our land and banish him!
> — **Iblis**: No! Haven't you seen the sweetness of his speech? He will go to others and rally them against you!
>
> — **Abu Jahl**: I propose that we take from each tribe a strong young man, give each one a sharp sword, then they go to him and strike him as one man, killing him! Thus his blood will be dispersed among the tribes, and Banu 'Abd Manaf will not be able to fight all of Quraysh, so they will accept blood money!
>
> — **Iblis**: This is the plan! There is no other!

---

### The Revelation Descends

Allah revealed to His Prophet ﷺ their plot:

> **﴿ And when those who disbelieved plotted against you to imprison you, or kill you, or expel you. They plot and Allah plots, and Allah is the best of planners ﴾**
> — Surah Al-Anfal, verse 30

And he was permitted to emigrate.

>
> Abu Bakr said: *"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ does not come at this hour except for an important matter!"*
>
> The Prophet ﷺ entered and said: *"Send out those who are with you"*
>
> Abu Bakr said: *"They are only my two daughters, O Messenger of Allah!"* ('Aisha and Asma)

---

### The Young Men Surround the House

> 📜 **The Scene**:
>
> Young men from every tribe gathered around the Prophet's ﷺ house, swords drawn, waiting for him to come out so they could strike him as one.
>
> The Prophet ﷺ ordered 'Ali رضي الله عنه to sleep in his bed and cover himself with his green cloak.
>
> He told him: *"Sleep in my bed and cover yourself with my green Hadrami cloak. Sleep in it, for nothing you dislike will reach you from them"*

---

### The Miraculous Exit

> 📜 **The Scene**:
>
> The Prophet ﷺ came out of his house while the men waited at his door. He took a handful of dust and threw it on their heads while reciting:
>
> **﴿ And We have put a barrier before them and a barrier behind them, and We have covered them so they cannot see ﴾**
>
> He passed among them and they did not see him! Allah took away their sight!
>
> They kept waiting until morning. When the sun rose, 'Ali got up from the bed!
>
> They shouted: *"Where is Muhammad?!"*
>
> 'Ali said: *"Was I his keeper?! You told him to leave, so he left!"*

## 🕳️ The Cave of Thawr — Three Days of Miracles

### The Path to the Cave

> 📜 **The Scene**:
>
> The Prophet ﷺ and Abu Bakr walked southward — in the opposite direction of Medina — toward Mount Thawr. Abu Bakr walked sometimes in front of him, sometimes behind him.
>
> The Prophet ﷺ asked him: *"What is the matter with you, O Abu Bakr?"*
>
> He said: *"I think of the pursuers and walk behind you, then I think of ambushers and walk in front of you!"*
>
> When they reached the cave, Abu Bakr said: *"Stay here, O Messenger of Allah, until I check the cave for you"*
>
> He entered first and examined every crack and hole, plugging some with pieces of his garment, then he permitted the Prophet ﷺ to enter.

Quraysh announced a huge reward:

| Reward | Details |
|--------|---------|

Quraysh's horsemen set out in every direction searching for them...

---

### At the Cave Entrance

> 📜 **The Scene**:

>
> And they left!

---

## 🐪 The Journey to Medina

### The Beginning of the Journey

After three days, the pursuit had calmed. 'Abdullah ibn Urayqit came with two riding camels, and they set out at night via the coastal route.

---

### Suraqa ibn Malik

> 📜 **The Scene**:
>
> When Suraqa ibn Malik heard about the reward, he mounted his horse and followed their tracks. When he got close to them, Abu Bakr said: *"The pursuers have caught up with us, O Messenger of Allah!"*
>
> The Prophet ﷺ said: *"Do not grieve, Allah is with us"*
>
> The Prophet ﷺ supplicated against him, and his horse's legs sank into the ground up to its belly!
>
> Suraqa cried out: *"O Muhammad! I know this is your doing! Invoke Allah to deliver me from what has befallen me, and I promise you I will turn back those who pursue you!"*
>
> The Prophet ﷺ invoked for him and his horse was freed.

---

### The Bracelets of Chosroes

> 📜 **The Scene**:

>
> Then the Prophet ﷺ said to Suraqa: *"How will you be, O Suraqa, when you wear the bracelets of Chosroes?!"*
>
> Suraqa was amazed: Chosroes son of Hormuz, the king of Persia?!
>
> Years later, during the caliphate of 'Umar ibn al-Khattab رضي الله عنه, Persia was conquered and the treasures of Chosroes were brought. 'Umar summoned Suraqa and made him wear the bracelets and crown of Chosroes! The Prophet's ﷺ promise had come true!

---

### Umm Ma'bad al-Khuza'iyya

> 📜 **The Scene**:
>
> On the way, they passed by the tent of Umm Ma'bad al-Khuza'iyya. She was a courageous woman who offered food and drink to travelers. But the drought had decimated her flock.
>
> They asked her for food or drink, and she apologized: *"If we had anything, you would not need to ask for hospitality!"*
>
> The Prophet ﷺ saw a thin sheep in a corner of the tent and said: *"What is this sheep, O Umm Ma'bad?"*
>
> She said: *"A sheep that fatigue has left behind from the flock"*
>
> He said: *"Does it have any milk?"*
>
> She said: *"It is too weak for that!"*
>
> He said: *"Will you allow me to milk it?"*
>
> She said: *"By my father and mother! If you see it has milk, then milk it!"*
>
> He stroked its udder with his noble hand, pronounced the name of Allah, and milk flowed! He milked and filled a large container, gave her to drink until she was satisfied, then gave his companions to drink, then drank last, then milked again and left the container for her!

---

### Umm Ma'bad's Description of the Prophet ﷺ

When her husband Abu Ma'bad returned, he saw the milk and was amazed! He asked her and she told him. He said: *Describe him to me!*

She said — in the most beautiful description of the Prophet ﷺ:

> *"I saw a man of radiant purity, luminous face, fine form, not marred by corpulence nor diminished by thinness. Handsome and well-proportioned, with intensely black eyes, long eyelashes, a slightly husky voice, an elongated neck, a thick beard. Arched and joined eyebrows, when silent he inspires reverence, when speaking he radiates majesty. The most beautiful of people and most radiant from afar, the sweetest and finest from close up. Sweet of speech, neither brief nor verbose, like threaded pearls flowing down. Of medium height, neither too tall for the eye nor too short to be overlooked. A branch between two branches, he is the most splendid of the three and the noblest in worth. He has companions who surround him: when he speaks they listen, when he commands they hasten. Served and attended, neither frowning nor faultfinding."*

Abu Ma'bad said: *"This, by Allah, is the man of Quraysh they are searching for!"*

## 🌟 The Arrival at Quba

>
> He shouted at the top of his voice: *"O Banu Qayla! Here is your ancestor whom you have been waiting for!"*
>
> The people came out proclaiming "Allahu Akbar" and jubilating!

---

### The Mosque of Quba

The Prophet ﷺ stayed at Quba for fourteen days and founded the first mosque in Islam — **the Mosque of Quba**:

---

### The Legendary Welcome

> 📜 **The Scene**:

>
> *"Come to us! We have numbers, equipment, and protection!"*
>
> He ﷺ would say: *"Let her go, she is guided"*

The camel walked until it knelt on a date-drying ground belonging to two orphans from Banu Najjar.

---

### The Blessed Place

The camel knelt, then stood up, then returned and knelt at the same spot and turned around! The Prophet ﷺ dismounted.
