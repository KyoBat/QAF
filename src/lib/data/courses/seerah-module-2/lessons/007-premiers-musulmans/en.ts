## 📖 Introduction

### Three Years in Secrecy

After the revelation of Surah **Al-Muddaththir**...

The Prophet ﷺ began calling people to Islam...

But **secretly**... in the shadows... in whispers...

**Why?** Because Quraysh would never accept a religion that threatened its power and status!

Thus began **three years** of secret preaching...
