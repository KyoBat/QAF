**🎬 At the market of Badr... the day faith triumphed**

*Three Companions discuss before the battle...*

**Abdullah ibn Mas'ûd:** O 'Ammâr, O Sa'd... what do you say we share whatever we obtain today?

**'Ammâr ibn Yâsir:** *(enthusiastically)* Excellent idea! Whatever one of us obtains will be for all of us.

**Sa'd ibn Abî Waqqâs:** *(agreeing)* Agreed. We share through our efforts.

*After the battle...*

**Ibn Mas'ûd:** *(empty-handed)* I obtained nothing...

**'Ammâr:** *(likewise)* Neither did I...

**Sa'd:** *(leading two captives)* As for me, I obtained these two!

**Ibn Mas'ûd:** *(with a smile)* May Allah bless us all... We agreed before the work.

*They divided the spoils equally, despite the disparity in results!*

</div>

This is the jurisprudence of partnership: **agreement before work, fairness after.**

## Definition of Partnership

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Etymologically:**

Partnership (shirka) comes from mixing and blending. The Arabs say: "I partnered with him in the matter" — meaning I entered into it with him.

</div>

### Terminology

## Legitimacy of Partnership

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 From the Book of Allah:**

﴾And indeed, many associates oppress one another, except those who believe and do righteous deeds, and they are few﴿ [Sâd: 24]

*The khulâtâ' = the partners*

</div>

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 On Inheritance:**

﴾They are then partners in the third﴿ [An-Nisâ': 12]

*If the uterine siblings inherit, they share the third equally.*

</div>

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 The Magnificent Hadith Qudsî:**

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Allah the Most High says: I am the third of two partners as long as one does not betray the other. If he betrays him, I withdraw from between them."**

📚 Reported by Abû Dâwûd and Al-Hâkim who authenticated it

</div>

<!-- DIAGRAM:sharikah-blessing -->

**Consensus of the Ummah:** Scholars are unanimous on the permissibility of partnership in general.

## Types of Partnerships

<!-- DIAGRAM:sharikah-types -->

---

## First Type: Shirkat al-'Inân

<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 In Baghdad... two partners negotiate**

**Ahmad the merchant:** I have 10,000 dinars, I want us to partner in the silk trade.

**Khâlid the merchant:** And I have 5,000 dinars. But I know the caravan routes and I negotiate well.

**Ahmad:** *(thinking)* Your capital is half of mine... but your expertise is priceless!

**Khâlid:** What do you say? Profits split 50-50, despite the difference in capital?

**Ahmad:** *(shaking his hand)* Deal! I put in more money, and you work more.

**The Judge:** *(later)* Correct! This is a shirkat al-'inân. The profit is according to your agreement.

</div>

### Definition

> That two or more people partner with their capitals to work in it and share the profits.

<!-- DIAGRAM:sharikah-inan -->

### Conditions

| # | Condition | Reason |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Capital in currency | Ease of valuation and division |
| 2 | Capital known | Avoid ignorance and uncertainty |
| 3 | Profit as percentage | Not a fixed amount but a % |
| 4 | Each partner can act | To realize the partnership |

### Rules

| Element | Rule | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Profit | According to agreement | 50%-50% or 60%-40% possible |
| Loss | Proportional to capital | The one with 60% loses 60% |
| Work | Disparity is permitted | One may work more |

**Ruling:** Valid by consensus — it is the most recognized of partnerships.

---

## Second Type: Shirkat al-Mufâwada

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Definition:**

That two or more people partner being **equal in everything**:
- Capital
- Work
- Profits and losses
- Each is a guarantor for the other

</div>

<!-- DIAGRAM:sharikah-mufawada -->

**Reason for disagreement:** It is nearly impossible for two people to be equal in everything!

---

## Third Type: Shirkat al-Abdân (of Bodies)

<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 Return to Badr... the story of the three Companions**

**Abdullah ibn Mas'ûd:** *(narrating)* I partnered with 'Ammâr and Sa'd in whatever we would obtain on the day of Badr...

**The Narrator:** What happened?

**Ibn Mas'ûd:** Sa'd brought back two captives, and 'Ammâr and I brought back nothing.

**The Narrator:** How did you divide?

**Ibn Mas'ûd:** *(smiling)* We divided among ourselves! Because we agreed before the work.

📚 Reported by Abû Dâwûd and An-Nasâ'î

</div>

### Definition

> That two or more people partner in what they earn through their labor (their bodies) without capital.

**🎬 At the market of Medina...**

**'Âmir:** *(to his friend)* O Sa'îd, we don't have money to trade...

**Sa'îd:** But we have a good reputation! The merchants trust us.

**'Âmir:** *(enthusiastically)* True! If we went to merchant Mahmûd and bought on credit...

**Sa'îd:** We sell the goods, pay him back and split the profit!

**'Âmir:** This is what they call... shirkat al-wujûh!

</div>

### Definition

> That two people partner in what they buy **through their reputation and people's trust** (on credit), then sell it and share the profit.

## Modern Companies

### Joint Stock Company

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Definition:**

A company whose capital is divided into **shares of equal value**, tradable, and each partner is only liable to the extent of their shares.

</div>

<!-- DIAGRAM:sharikah-musahama -->

### Types of Joint Stock Companies by Islamic Ruling

<!-- DIAGRAM:sharikah-musahama-types -->

### Ruling on Mixed Companies

| Position | Conditions | Ruling |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Absolute prohibition | — | There is ribâ even if minor |
| Permissibility with conditions | 1. Main activity permissible | Permissible with purification |
| | 2. Haram revenues < 5% | of haram portion |
| | 3. Purification by donation | to the poor |

**⚠️ Important note:** The 5% threshold is a **contemporary ijtihad (scholarly interpretation)** from some Sharia boards, not a consensus. Some scholars absolutely forbid investment in mixed companies.

## Diminishing Partnership

<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 At the Islamic bank...**

**The Client:** I want to buy a house for 500,000 riyals, but I only have 100,000.

**Bank Employee:** We have an Islamic solution: diminishing partnership.

**The Client:** How does it work?

**The Employee:** We buy the house together — you 20% and us 80%.

**The Client:** Then?

**The Employee:** You live in the house and pay us rent for our share (80%). And each month you buy an additional portion from us.

**The Client:** *(understanding)* So my share increases and yours decreases... that's why it's called "diminishing"!

**The Employee:** Exactly! Until you own the house completely.

</div>

### How Does It Work?

<!-- DIAGRAM:musharakah-mutanaqisa -->

### Conditions for Islamic Validity

| # | Condition | Explanation |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Real partnership | Bank assumes risk of its share |
| 2 | Market rent | Not a fictitious rent |
| 3 | Separate contracts | Purchase separate from lease |
| 4 | No obligation | Client is free not to buy |

⚠️ **Warning:** Some banks apply diminishing partnership in a fictitious manner!

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf

### The Partnership of Ibn Mas'ûd, 'Ammâr and Sa'd

<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 The immortal lesson from Badr**

**Abdullah ibn Mas'ûd, may Allah be pleased with him:**

*"I partnered with 'Ammâr and Sa'd in whatever we would obtain on the day of Badr..."*

*"Sa'd came back with two captives, and neither 'Ammâr nor I brought back anything."*

**And yet... they divided the spoils equally!**

</div>

**Why?** Because they agreed on the partnership **before** the work, not after!

### Lessons Learned

<!-- DIAGRAM:sharikah-badr-lessons -->

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### Case One: Creating a Startup

**Question:** I'm a developer and my friend is a marketer. We want to create a tech company. I'll build the app and he'll bring clients. We don't have capital. How do we split the shares?

**Analysis:** Shirkat Abdân (partnership through labor) — Developer: programming work, Marketer: marketing work, Capital: none.

**Answer:** ✅ **Shirkat Abdân is permissible**

**Recommendations:**
1. Agree on a percentage (50%-50% or according to expected effort)
2. **Document the agreement in writing** — very important!
3. Define the mechanism for evaluating work and distribution
4. Agree on what happens if one withdraws

---

### Case Two: Buying Shares in Mixed Companies

**Question:** Aramco has a permissible main activity (oil), but places its surpluses in interest-based banks. Can we buy its shares?

**Analysis:** Mixed Company — Main activity: oil (halal) ✅, Banking transactions: ribâ (haram) ❌, Proportion: very minor.

**Answer:** ⚠️ **Scholars disagree:**

| Opinion | Ruling | Argument |
|---------|--------|----------|
| First | Prohibited | There is ribâ even if minor |
| Second | Permissible with conditions | Main activity permissible + purification |

**If you follow the permissibility opinion:**
- Purify the portion of illicit profits by donating to the poor
- Calculate the percentage of usurious revenues from financial reports

---

### Case Three: Diminishing Partnership for a House

**Question:** The Islamic bank offers a house purchase program: the bank pays 80% and I pay 20%, then I buy back their share monthly while paying rent for their portion. Is this permissible?

**Answer:** ✅ **Permissible with conditions:**

| Condition | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1. Real partnership | Bank assumes risks (if house burns, it loses 80%) |
| 2. Market rent | Not a fixed rent regardless of market |
| 3. Separate contracts | Each share purchase by separate contract |
| 4. No obligation | You're not obligated to buy if you don't want |

⚠️ **Important warning:** Some banks apply diminishing partnership **in a fictitious manner**!
- Verify: Does the bank assume real risks?
- Or are all risks on you?

---

### Case Four: Partnership in a Restaurant with Different Roles

**Question:** Three people want to open a restaurant:
- The first puts in 500,000 riyals
- The second puts in 300,000 riyals
- The third will manage the restaurant without capital

How are profits and losses distributed?

**Analysis:** Shirkat 'Inân + labor (mixed) — Partner 1: 500,000 (capital), Partner 2: 300,000 (capital), Partner 3: labor (management).

**Answer:**

**Profits** — According to agreement (example):
| Partner | Percentage | Justification |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| The one with 500,000 | 40% | Largest capital |
| The one with 300,000 | 25% | Medium capital |
| The manager | 35% | His management work |

**Losses** — Proportional to capital only:
| Partner | % loss | Reason |
|---------|--------|--------|
| The one with 500,000 | 62.5% | 500,000 ÷ 800,000 |
| The one with 300,000 | 37.5% | 300,000 ÷ 800,000 |
| The manager | 0% | Did not put capital (loses effort only) |

### Case Five: Partner's Betrayal

**Question:** I discovered that my partner is stealing from the company's money. What should I do according to Sharia?

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Remember the Hadith Qudsî:**

**"I am the third of two partners as long as one does not betray the other. If he betrays him, I withdraw from between them."**

</div>

**Answer — Practical steps:**

1️⃣ **Document the evidence** — Records, receipts, witnesses

2️⃣ **Confront him and demand your due** — With wisdom and kindness first

3️⃣ **If he doesn't respond: courts** — Commercial courts

4️⃣ **Dissolution + Guarantee** — Claim what he destroyed or stole

**Remember:** The betrayer is liable, and the blessing departs!

---

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 The Hadith Qudsî:**

**"I am the third of two partners as long as one does not betray the other. If he betrays him, I withdraw from between them."**

</div>

Allah the Most High is with the partners... He protects and blesses them... **as long as they are sincere and faithful.**

### Reflect on Your Partnerships:

🔹 Are you as faithful with your partner's money as with your own?

🔹 Do you document agreements in writing to preserve rights and avoid conflicts?

🔹 In case of disagreement, do you resort to arbitration or take your due by yourself?

🔹 Before partnership, do you inquire about the partner's character and faithfulness?

**The Golden Rule:**

> Successful partnership is built on **trust and transparency**,
> and betrayal destroys **the blessing** before it destroys **the money**.
