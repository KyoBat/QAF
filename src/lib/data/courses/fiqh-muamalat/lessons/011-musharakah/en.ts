## 📖 Stories from the Salaf

### The Partnership of Ibn Mas'ud, Ammar, and Sa'd on the Day of Badr

Abdullah ibn Mas'ud رضي الله عنه narrated:

> **"Ammar, Sa'd and I partnered in what we would obtain on the day of Badr."**

3. ✅ **Fairness among partners** — despite different outcomes
4. ✅ **Trust is the foundation of partnership** — they were companions before being partners

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

> **"I am the third of the two partners as long as one of them does not betray his companion"** — Divine hadith

Allah تعالى is with partners, protecting and blessing them... **as long as they are honest and trustworthy.**

Reflect on your partnerships:

🔹 Are you as trustworthy with your partner's money as with your own?

🔹 Do you document agreements in writing to preserve rights and avoid disputes?

🔹 When disagreements arise, do you resort to Shariah arbitration or take matters into your own hands?

🔹 Before entering a partnership, do you ask about the partner's character and trustworthiness?

**Remember:** Successful partnership is built on trust and transparency, and betrayal destroys blessing before it destroys money.
