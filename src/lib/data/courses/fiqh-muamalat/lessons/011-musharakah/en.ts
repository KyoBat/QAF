**🎬 At the market of Badr... the day faith triumphed**

*Three Companions discuss before the battle...*

**Abdullah ibn Mas'ûd:** O 'Ammâr, O Sa'd... what do you say we share whatever we obtain today?

**'Ammâr ibn Yâsir:** *(enthusiastically)* Excellent idea! Whatever one of us obtains will be for all of us.

**Sa'd ibn Abî Waqqâs:** *(agreeing)* Agreed. We share through our efforts.

*After the battle...*

**Ibn Mas'ûd:** *(empty-handed)* I obtained nothing...

**'Ammâr:** *(likewise)* Neither did I...

**Sa'd:** *(leading two captives)* As for me, I obtained these two!

**Ibn Mas'ûd:** *(with a smile)* May Allah bless us all... We agreed before the work.

*They divided the spoils equally, despite the disparity in results!*

</div>

This is the jurisprudence of partnership: **agreement before work, fairness after.**

## Definition of Partnership

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Etymologically:**

Partnership (shirka) comes from mixing and blending. The Arabs say: "I partnered with him in the matter" — meaning I entered into it with him.

## Legitimacy of Partnership

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 From the Book of Allah:**

﴾And indeed, many associates oppress one another, except those who believe and do righteous deeds, and they are few﴿ [Sâd: 24]

*The khulâtâ' = the partners*

</div>

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 On Inheritance:**

﴾They are then partners in the third﴿ [An-Nisâ': 12]

*If the uterine siblings inherit, they share the third equally.*

</div>

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 The Magnificent Hadith Qudsî:**

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Allah the Most High says: I am the third of two partners as long as one does not betray the other. If he betrays him, I withdraw from between them."**

📚 Reported by Abû Dâwûd and Al-Hâkim who authenticated it

## First Type: Shirkat al-'Inân

<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 In Baghdad... two partners negotiate**

**Ahmad the merchant:** I have 10,000 dinars, I want us to partner in the silk trade.

**Khâlid the merchant:** And I have 5,000 dinars. But I know the caravan routes and I negotiate well.

**Ahmad:** *(thinking)* Your capital is half of mine... but your expertise is priceless!

**Khâlid:** What do you say? Profits split 50-50, despite the difference in capital?

**Ahmad:** *(shaking his hand)* Deal! I put in more money, and you work more.

**The Judge:** *(later)* Correct! This is a shirkat al-'inân. The profit is according to your agreement.

</div>

### Definition

> That two or more people partner with their capitals to work in it and share the profits.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
\`\`\`

### Conditions

| # | Condition | Reason |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Capital in currency | Ease of valuation and division |
| 2 | Capital known | Avoid ignorance and uncertainty |
| 3 | Profit as percentage | Not a fixed amount but a % |
| 4 | Each partner can act | To realize the partnership |

### Rules

| Element | Rule | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Profit | According to agreement | 50%-50% or 60%-40% possible |
| Loss | Proportional to capital | The one with 60% loses 60% |
| Work | Disparity is permitted | One may work more |

**Ruling:** Valid by consensus — it is the most recognized of partnerships.

## Second Type: Shirkat al-Mufâwada

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Definition:**

That two or more people partner being **equal in everything**:
- Capital
- Work
- Profits and losses
- Each is a guarantor for the other

│      Loss               =         Loss          │
│      Guarantee          =         Guarantee     │

├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Ruling:                                        │
│  • Majority: invalid (rarely achievable)        │
│  • Hanafis: valid                               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
\`\`\`

**Reason for disagreement:** It is nearly impossible for two people to be equal in everything!

## Third Type: Shirkat al-Abdân (of Bodies)

<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 Return to Badr... the story of the three Companions**

**Abdullah ibn Mas'ûd:** *(narrating)* I partnered with 'Ammâr and Sa'd in whatever we would obtain on the day of Badr...

**The Narrator:** What happened?

**Ibn Mas'ûd:** Sa'd brought back two captives, and 'Ammâr and I brought back nothing.

**The Narrator:** How did you divide?

**Ibn Mas'ûd:** *(smiling)* We divided among ourselves! Because we agreed before the work.

📚 Reported by Abû Dâwûd and An-Nasâ'î

## Fourth Type: Shirkat al-Wujûh (of Reputations)

<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 At the market of Medina...**

**'Âmir:** *(to his friend)* O Sa'îd, we don't have money to trade...

**Sa'îd:** But we have a good reputation! The merchants trust us.

**'Âmir:** *(enthusiastically)* True! If we went to merchant Mahmûd and bought on credit...

**Sa'îd:** We sell the goods, pay him back and split the profit!

**'Âmir:** This is what they call... shirkat al-wujûh!

</div>

### Definition

> That two people partner in what they buy **through their reputation and people's trust** (on credit), then sell it and share the profit.

## Diminishing Partnership

<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 At the Islamic bank...**

**The Client:** I want to buy a house for 500,000 riyals, but I only have 100,000.

**Bank Employee:** We have an Islamic solution: diminishing partnership.

**The Client:** How does it work?

**The Employee:** We buy the house together — you 20% and us 80%.

**The Client:** Then?

**The Employee:** You live in the house and pay us rent for our share (80%). And each month you buy an additional portion from us.

**The Client:** *(understanding)* So my share increases and yours decreases... that's why it's called "diminishing"!

**The Employee:** Exactly! Until you own the house completely.

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf

### The Partnership of Ibn Mas'ûd, 'Ammâr and Sa'd

<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 The immortal lesson from Badr**

**Abdullah ibn Mas'ûd, may Allah be pleased with him:**

*"I partnered with 'Ammâr and Sa'd in whatever we would obtain on the day of Badr..."*

*"Sa'd came back with two captives, and neither 'Ammâr nor I brought back anything."*

**And yet... they divided the spoils equally!**

</div>

**Why?** Because they agreed on the partnership **before** the work, not after!

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### Case One: Creating a Startup

**Question:** I'm a developer and my friend is a marketer. We want to create a tech company. I'll build the app and he'll bring clients. We don't have capital. How do we split the shares?

**Analysis:**
\`\`\`
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          Shirkat Abdân                  │
│    (partnership through labor)         │

│ Developer: programming work            │
│ Marketer: marketing work               │
│ Capital: none                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
\`\`\`

**Answer:** ✅ **Shirkat Abdân is permissible**

**Recommendations:**
1. Agree on a percentage (50%-50% or according to expected effort)
2. **Document the agreement in writing** — very important!
3. Define the mechanism for evaluating work and distribution
4. Agree on what happens if one withdraws

### Case Two: Buying Shares in Mixed Companies

**Question:** Aramco has a permissible main activity (oil), but places its surpluses in interest-based banks. Can we buy its shares?

**Analysis:**
\`\`\`
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│       Mixed Company                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Main activity: oil (halal) ✅           │
│ Banking transactions: ribâ (haram) ❌   │
│ Proportion: very minor                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
\`\`\`

**Answer:** ⚠️ **Scholars disagree:**

| Opinion | Ruling | Argument |
|---------|--------|----------|
| First | Prohibited | There is ribâ even if minor |
| Second | Permissible with conditions | Main activity permissible + purification |

**If you follow the permissibility opinion:**
- Purify the portion of illicit profits by donating to the poor
- Calculate the percentage of usurious revenues from financial reports

### Case Three: Diminishing Partnership for a House

**Question:** The Islamic bank offers a house purchase program: the bank pays 80% and I pay 20%, then I buy back their share monthly while paying rent for their portion. Is this permissible?

**Answer:** ✅ **Permissible with conditions:**

| Condition | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1. Real partnership | Bank assumes risks (if house burns, it loses 80%) |
| 2. Market rent | Not a fixed rent regardless of market |
| 3. Separate contracts | Each share purchase by separate contract |
| 4. No obligation | You're not obligated to buy if you don't want |

⚠️ **Important warning:** Some banks apply diminishing partnership **in a fictitious manner**!
- Verify: Does the bank assume real risks?
- Or are all risks on you?

### Case Four: Partnership in a Restaurant with Different Roles

**Question:** Three people want to open a restaurant:
- The first puts in 500,000 riyals
- The second puts in 300,000 riyals
- The third will manage the restaurant without capital

How are profits and losses distributed?

**Analysis:**
\`\`\`
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│    Shirkat 'Inân + labor (mixed)       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Partner 1: 500,000 (capital)           │
│ Partner 2: 300,000 (capital)           │
│ Partner 3: labor (management)          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
\`\`\`

**Answer:**

**Profits** — According to agreement (example):
| Partner | Percentage | Justification |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| The one with 500,000 | 40% | Largest capital |
| The one with 300,000 | 25% | Medium capital |
| The manager | 35% | His management work |

**Losses** — Proportional to capital only:
| Partner | % loss | Reason |
|---------|--------|--------|
| The one with 500,000 | 62.5% | 500,000 ÷ 800,000 |
| The one with 300,000 | 37.5% | 300,000 ÷ 800,000 |
| The manager | 0% | Did not put capital (loses effort only) |
