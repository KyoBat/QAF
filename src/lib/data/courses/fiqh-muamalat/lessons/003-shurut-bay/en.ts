**Imam Ibrahim:** Have you learned the rules of buying and selling?

**The Young Man:** No... I'll learn through practice!

*The Imam stands up and says firmly:*

**Imam Ibrahim:** "Whoever enters the market without knowledge of fiqh will consume riba (usury), whether he wants to or not!"

**Imam Ibrahim:** "Learn the conditions of sale before you sell... for how many contracts appear valid but are corrupt inside!"

## 📖 Introduction: Why Conditions?

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 The Foundational Hadith**

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **"Muslims are bound by their conditions, except a condition that makes lawful what is unlawful or makes unlawful what is lawful."**

*(Narrated by Abu Dawud and at-Tirmidhi)*

</div>

**Conditions in sale have two functions:**

1. **Protecting Rights** — Preventing injustice and fraud
2. **Ensuring Consent** — Guaranteeing true mutual agreement

## 👥 Conditions of the Contracting Parties (Seller and Buyer)

### First Condition: Sanity 🧠

**🎬 Scene: At the Store**

*A man unconscious due to intoxication enters a store...*

*He points to an item and hands over money...*

**The Store Owner:** Is this a valid sale?

</div>

| **The intoxicated** | ❌ His contract is invalid according to the correct view |
| **The sleeper** | ❌ His contract is invalid |

## 📖 Stories from the Righteous Predecessors: Imam Ahmad's Piety

<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 Story: Honesty in Conditions**

*A man came to Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, may Allah have mercy on him...*

**The Man:** O Imam, I bought goods from a man, then discovered he was **coerced** into selling by his creditor!

**Imam Ahmad:** "The sale of the coerced is not valid, because consent is a condition. **Return his property and take back your money.**"

**The Man:** But I didn't know he was coerced at the time of purchase!

**Imam Ahmad:** "Does it harm you to return the right to its owner? The Prophet ﷺ said: **Fulfill the trust of one who entrusted you, and do not betray one who betrayed you.**"

</div>

**The Lesson:** The conditions of sale were established to protect rights. The Muslim merchant ensures the **validity of his contracts**, not just their appearance.

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases — Test Your Understanding!

### Case 1: Purchase by a Child

<div class="scene-box">

A **father** sent his son (**10 years old**) to buy bread from the grocery store.

**Question:** Is this sale valid?

</div>

**Answer:** ✅ Yes, because:
- The child is **discerning**
- The transaction is **minor**
- It is **customarily authorized** by the guardian

---

### Case 2: The Earnest Money Sale

<div class="scene-box">

**Zayd** paid earnest money (5000) to reserve an apartment for 200,000.

Then he **backed out** and didn't complete the purchase.

**Question:** Is he entitled to get the earnest money back?

</div>

**Answer:** ❌ No, according to the preponderant view.

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Earnest Money Rule**

- Earnest money is **permissible** according to the Hanbalis and the Fiqh Council
- If the sale is completed: it's deducted from the price
- Otherwise: the seller keeps it (compensation for reserving the item)

</div>

---

### Case 3: Sale of a Mortgaged Car

<div class="scene-box">

**Ali** sold his car while it was **mortgaged to the bank** without informing the buyer.

**Question:** What is the ruling?

</div>

**Answer:** ❌ The sale is **defective**.

**Reason:**
- The mortgaged property is encumbered by another's right
- The seller cannot complete delivery

**Solution:** Remove the mortgage first or inform the buyer.

---

### Case 4: Installment Purchase at a Higher Price

<div class="scene-box">

Phone price **cash: $1000**

Price **on installment: $1200**

**Question:** Is this usury?

</div>

**Answer:** ✅ **No, it's permissible** — if the price is determined at the time of contract.

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 What Is Forbidden:**

Saying: "Take it for 1000 cash or 1200 on installment" **without specifying** which one — because this is **two sales in one**.

</div>

---

### Case 5: Selling What You Don't Own

<div class="scene-box">

**The merchant** promised the customer to sell him goods **tomorrow** when he has **not yet purchased them** from the supplier.

**Question:** What is the ruling?

2. **Salam Contract** — with its conditions
