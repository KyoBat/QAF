<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 Opening Scene: At the Madinah Market**

*Banu Qaynuqa' Market. The sun rises over Madinah the Radiant. A man with a foreign face enters the market for the first time...*

*It is **'Abd ar-Rahman ibn 'Awf** رضي الله عنه, the emigrant who left all his wealth in Makkah.*

*That day, his brother in Islam **Sa'd ibn ar-Rabi'** the Ansari offered him:*

**Sa'd:** "My brother, I am one of the wealthiest in Madinah. Take half of my wealth! And I have two wives: see which one pleases you, I will divorce her so you can marry her!"

*'Abd ar-Rahman remained silent for a moment... then said with the dignity of a believer:*

**'Abd ar-Rahman:** "May Allah bless your family and your wealth... **Show me the way to the market.**"

*He went to the market... and began to trade...*

*A few days later, the Prophet ﷺ saw him with traces of yellow perfume (the bride's perfume)...*

**The Prophet ﷺ:** "Mahyam, O 'Abd ar-Rahman?" *(What happened?)*

**'Abd ar-Rahman:** "I got married, O Messenger of Allah!"

**The Prophet ﷺ:** "What dowry did you give her?"

**'Abd ar-Rahman:** "A date-stone weight of gold."

*(Sahih al-Bukhari 3781)*

*From zero... to marriage in a few days... to becoming one of the ten wealthiest men in Islamic history!*

*How? **Through the fiqh of lawful transactions.***

> **This science** that 'Abd ar-Rahman ibn 'Awf learned is what you will learn in this course.

</div>

## 🔥 Why is This Science Essential?

### 1️⃣ Because You Make Transactions Every Day!

Think about it... **How many financial transactions do you make daily?**

| Time | Transaction |
|------|-------------|
| Morning | Buying coffee ☕ |
| Noon | Paying for lunch 🍽️ |
| Afternoon | Bank transfer via phone 📱 |
| Evening | Online shopping 🛒 |
| Night | Paying rent or installment 🏠 |

**All of these are transactions!** Do you know their legal rulings?

### 2️⃣ Because Halal and Haram are Clear... for Those Who Learn

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Hadith of an-Nu'man ibn Bashir**

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:

> **"The halal is clear and the haram is clear. Between them are doubtful matters that many people do not know. Whoever avoids the doubtful matters protects his religion and honor."**

*(Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim)*

</div>

### 3️⃣ Because Wealth is One of the Five Necessities

<!-- DIAGRAM:five-necessities -->

## 🌳 The Golden Rules of Transactions

### First Rule: The Default Ruling is Permissibility

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Legal Maxim**

> **"The default ruling in transactions is permissibility and lawfulness, except what evidence indicates is prohibited."**

</div>

**Notice the fundamental difference:**

| Worship | Transactions |
|---------|--------------|
| The default is **prohibition** | The default is **permission** |
| Only legislated by evidence | Permitted unless evidence of prohibition |
| "Worship as you were taught" | "Transact as you wish except what's forbidden" |

### Second Rule: Muslims are Bound by Their Conditions

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Hadith of 'Amr ibn 'Awf**

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **"Muslims are bound by their conditions, except a condition that makes lawful what is unlawful or unlawful what is lawful."**

*(Reported by Abu Dawud)*

</div>

**Meaning:** Agree on whatever you want in the contract, as long as it doesn't contradict the Law.

### Third Rule: No Harm Shall Be Inflicted or Reciprocated

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Hadith of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri**

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **"No harm shall be inflicted or reciprocated."**

*(Reported by Ibn Majah)*

</div>

**Practical Applications:**

| Forbidden | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| ❌ Fraud | Harms the buyer |
| ❌ Monopoly | Harms society |
| ❌ Excessive uncertainty | Leads to disputes |
| ❌ False advertising | Deceives people |

### Fourth Rule: What Matters is Intentions, Not Words

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Legal Maxim**

> **"What matters in contracts are intentions and meanings, not words and formulations."**

</div>

**Example:** If you call a usurious loan "Islamic financing"... does its ruling change? **No!** What matters is the reality, not the name.

## 🏛️ The Pillars of a Contract

<!-- DIAGRAM:contract-pillars -->

### Conditions for the Contracting Parties

| Condition | Detail | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Sanity** | Contract of an insane person is invalid | — |
| **Discernment** | A discerning child can contract with guardian's consent | 10-year-old buying candy |
| **Maturity** | For major transactions | Real estate sale |
| **Free will** | Contract of one coerced is invalid | — |

### Conditions for the Formula

1. **Concordance** — Offer and acceptance must match
2. **Continuity** — No long gap between them
3. **Firmness** — No suspension on an unknown condition

## ⛔ The Four Major Prohibitions

<div class="scene-box">

**🚫 Beware of These Four!**

*Every transaction in the world is permissible... unless it falls into one of these four:*

</div>

### 1️⃣ Usury (Riba) — The Greatest Financial Sin

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 The Declaration of War!**

Allah تعالى said:

> **﴿O you who believe! Fear Allah and give up what remains of usury, if you are believers. If you do not, then be informed of a war from Allah and His Messenger﴾**

[Al-Baqarah: 278-279]

</div>

### 2️⃣ Uncertainty (Gharar) — Excessive Ignorance

Such as: selling fish in the water, a bird in the sky, or something completely unknown.

### 3️⃣ Fraud and Deception

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Hadith of Abu Hurayra**

The Prophet ﷺ passed by a pile of food. He put his hand inside and his fingers touched moisture...

> **"What is this, O owner of the food?"**

He said: Rain touched it, O Messenger of Allah.

> **"Why didn't you put it on top so people could see it? Whoever deceives us is not one of us!"**

*(Sahih Muslim 102)*

</div>

### 4️⃣ Devouring People's Wealth Unjustly

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Verse from al-Baqarah**

> **﴿And do not devour your wealth among yourselves unjustly﴾**

[Al-Baqarah: 188]

</div>

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases — Test Your Understanding!

### Case 1: Working in a Supermarket

<div class="scene-box">

**Ahmad** works in a large supermarket. The store sells halal products... **and alcohol too**.

**Question:** Is it permissible to continue working there?

</div>

**Answer:** ❌ It is not permissible to sell alcohol, transport it, or assist in its sale.

<div class="quote-box">

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Allah has cursed alcohol, the one who drinks it, the one who serves it, the one who sells it, the one who buys it, the one who presses it, the one for whom it's pressed, the one who carries it, and the one to whom it's carried."**

*(Reported by Abu Dawud)*

</div>

**Solution:** If his department doesn't directly deal with forbidden products in a large store, it's easier. Otherwise, he should seek an alternative.

---

### Case 2: The Verbal Agreement

<div class="scene-box">

**Khaled** verbally agreed with his friend to buy his car for $50,000.

Then **the seller backed out** because he found someone who pays more!

**Question:** Is the verbal agreement binding?

</div>

**Answer:** ✅ Yes! A verbal contract is valid and legally binding if its pillars are met.

> But written documentation is preferable: ﴿When you contract a debt for a specified term, **write it down**﴾

---

### Case 3: Selling Before Taking Possession

<div class="scene-box">

**Muhammad** bought merchandise from a merchant for $10,000.

**Before receiving it**, he found a buyer who wants it for $12,000!

He immediately sold it to him and made $2,000 without even seeing it!

**Question:** What is the ruling?

</div>

**Answer:** ❌ It is not permissible to sell what you bought before taking possession of it.

<div class="quote-box">

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Whoever buys food, let him not sell it until he has taken possession of it."**

*(Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim)*

</div>

---

### Case 4: The Additional Condition

<div class="scene-box">

When buying a car, **the buyer** stipulated that the seller must fix an air conditioning defect.

**Question:** Is this condition valid?

</div>

**Answer:** ✅ Yes, it is a valid condition. Because it serves the interest of the contract, **and Muslims are bound by their conditions**.
