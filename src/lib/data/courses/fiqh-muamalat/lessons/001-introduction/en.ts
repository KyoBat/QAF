## The Fundamental Rules of Transactions

### First Rule: The Default in Transactions is Permissibility

> "The default in transactions is permissibility and lawfulness, except what evidence indicates is prohibited."

**The difference from acts of worship:**
| Acts of Worship | Transactions |
|-----------------|--------------|
| The default is prohibition | The default is permission |
| Only legislated with evidence | Permitted unless evidence of prohibition |

### Second Rule: Muslims Are Bound by Their Conditions

> The Prophet ﷺ said: "Muslims are bound by their conditions, except a condition that makes lawful what is unlawful or unlawful what is lawful." [Reported by Abu Dawud]

### Third Rule: No Harm and No Reciprocal Harm

> The Prophet ﷺ said: "No harm and no reciprocal harm." [Reported by Ibn Majah]

**Applications:**
- Prohibition of fraud and deception
- Prohibition of harmful monopoly
- Prohibition of uncertainty leading to dispute

### Fourth Rule: What Counts Are the Intentions and Meanings

> "What counts in contracts are the intentions and meanings, not the words and formulations."
