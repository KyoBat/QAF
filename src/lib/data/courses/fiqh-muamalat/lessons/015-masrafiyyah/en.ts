## 📖 Stories from the Salaf

### Imam Ibn Taymiyyah's Position on Money Exchange

**Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah** رحمه الله was asked about money changers who lend people with surplus, and he said:

> "This is the usury upon which the Ummah is unanimous in its prohibition, and it is among the major sins. The Prophet ﷺ cursed the consumer of usury, its payer, its recorder, and its witnesses."

Then he said رحمه الله:

> "As for one who lends a good loan without stipulating any surplus, this is among the best deeds, and they have a great reward with Allah."

**The lesson:** The fundamental difference between good loan and usury is the **stipulated surplus**.

---

### The Beginning of Islamic Banks - An Inspiring Story

In **1963 CE**, the Egyptian economist **Dr. Ahmad al-Najjar** established the first Islamic banking experiment in the village of **Mit Ghamr** in Egypt.

Dr. al-Najjar said:

> "I saw farmers needing financing to buy seeds and equipment, finding only usury. So I said: Why don't we establish a bank that finances through mudarabah and partnership?"

The experiment succeeded and spread throughout the Muslim world, and today the size of Islamic banking **exceeds 3 trillion dollars**.

**The lesson:** Islamic alternatives are possible and successful, but they require will and creativity.

---

### The Position of Fatwa Bodies on Banks

In **1965 CE**, the **Islamic Research Academy** of al-Azhar issued a fatwa prohibiting bank interest.

And in **1986 CE**, the **International Islamic Fiqh Academy** issued its decision that:

> "Every surplus or interest on a debt whose term has arrived and the debtor is unable to pay, in exchange for deferment, and likewise the surplus or interest on a loan from the beginning of the contract — these two forms are prohibited usury according to Shariah."

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### Case One: Opening an Account in a Usurious Bank

**Question:** There is no Islamic bank in my country. Is it permissible to open an account in a usurious bank?

**Answer:**

### Case Two: Buying a Car in Installments

**Question:** I want to buy a car. The conventional bank gives me a loan at 5% interest. The Islamic bank sells it to me through murabaha at 7% profit. Which should I choose?

**Answer:** ✅ **The Islamic bank** even if more expensive:

| Islamic Murabaha | Usurious Loan |
|------------------|---------------|
| Sale contract, price is fixed | Loan contract with interest |
| No increase with delay (in principle) | Interest accumulates with delay |
| Bank owns the car first | Bank only lends money |
| Halal | Absolutely haram |

⚠️ **Warning:** Some "Islamic" banks violate the conditions, so verify:
- That the bank owns the car before selling it to you
- Absence of usurious delay penalties

---

### Case Three: Credit Card

**Question:** I have a Visa card from a usurious bank. I use it and pay the full amount before month-end so I pay no interest. What is the ruling?

**Answer:** **There is disagreement among scholars:**

| Opinion | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| ❌ Prohibition | The contract includes an interest condition upon delay |
| ✅ Permission for need | If committed to full payment and pays no interest |

**More cautious:** Use cards from Islamic banks.

**Answer:** ✅ **Halal** if conditions are met:

3. **No guarantee of capital:** Profit and loss are shared
4. **Purification:** If forbidden income exists, it is donated

---

### Case Five: Commodity Murabaha (Tawarruq)

**Question:** I need cash liquidity. The bank buys metals from the exchange then sells them to me in installments, then authorizes me to sell them immediately. What is the ruling?

**Answer:** **Disagreement among jurists:**

| Opinion | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| ✅ Permission | The Islamic Fiqh Academy decision permits it with conditions |

**Conditions according to those who permit:**
1. The bank must receive the commodity actually or constructively
2. The bank must not sell it to the party it bought from
3. It must be a real commodity, not fictitious

---

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

> **Question for reflection:**
>
> Allah تعالى says: ﴿Those who consume usury will not stand except like one whom Satan has driven to madness by his touch﴾
>
> - Why is the punishment for consuming usury so severe?
> - How does usurious dealing affect the individual and society?
> - What is the Muslim's role in supporting and developing Islamic alternatives?
>
> **Reflect:** The Prophet ﷺ said: "Usury has seventy-three doors, the least of which is like a man marrying his mother."
>
> Trivializing usurious dealings "for necessity" without searching for alternatives is negligence in a grave matter.
