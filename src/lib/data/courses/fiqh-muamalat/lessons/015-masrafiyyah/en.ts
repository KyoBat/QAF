**📖 Scene: In the Islamic Bank Manager's Office**

*A young man enters the Islamic bank manager's office, looking perplexed...*

**The Young Man:** As-salamu alaykum sir... I am very confused!

**The Manager:** Wa alaykum as-salam, please come in. What is troubling you?

**The Young Man:** I want to buy a house. The conventional bank gives me a loan at 5% interest, and you offer me Murabaha with 7% profit... Aren't you more expensive?! And how can you say you are halal and they are haram when the result is the same?!

**The Manager:** *(smiling)*
This is a question many ask... Listen, my son:
- **The conventional bank** lends you money and takes interest on the money ← This is **explicit riba**
- **We** buy the house and own it, then sell it to you with profit ← This is **lawful sale**

**The Young Man:** But the final result is that I pay more!

**The Manager:** The material result may be similar, but the **reality of the contract** is completely different:
- In riba: you pay money for money ← **Forbidden by Sharia**
- In sale: you pay money for a commodity ← **Permitted by Sharia**

*And Allah does not look only at the result, but at the reality of the transaction.*

### The Fundamental Difference: Conventional vs Islamic Banks

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Prophetic Warning**

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Allah has cursed the one who consumes riba, the one who pays it, the one who writes it, and the witnesses"**
>
> [Muslim]

Conventional banks are based on **riba**, while Islamic banks are based on **sale and partnership**.

## Part Two: Islamic Financing Modes

<div class="scene-box">

**📖 Scene: A Study Circle at the Mosque**

**The Student:** O Sheikh, how do Islamic banks finance if they don't lend with interest?

**The Sheikh:** Excellent question! Islamic banks don't lend, they **trade**.

**The Student:** What do you mean?

**The Sheikh:** Instead of giving you money that you return with a surplus, **I buy the goods and sell them to you with profit**.

**The Student:** But in the end I pay more!

**The Sheikh:** Yes, but the difference is in **the reality of the contract**:
- **Loan with interest** = money for money ← forbidden riba
- **Sale with profit** = commodity for money ← lawful trade

*Allah says: ﴾Allah has permitted trade and forbidden riba﴿*

</div>

### First Mode: Murabaha with Purchase Order

<div class="quote-box">

### Third: Credit Card

<div class="scene-box">

**📖 Scene: Consultation about the Visa Card**

**The Questioner:** O Sheikh, I have a Visa card from a conventional bank. I use it and pay the full amount before the end of the month, so I don't pay interest. What is the ruling?

**The Sheikh:** This issue has scholarly disagreement...

**The Questioner:** What is it?

**The Sheikh:**
- **Those who forbid** say: The contract contains the interest clause for late payment, so it's a usurious contract
- **Those who permit** say: If you commit to paying in full and don't actually pay interest, there's no harm

**⚠️ The preponderant view according to most Fiqh Academies:** Prohibition of conventional bank cards even with commitment to pay in full, because the contract contains a usurious clause.

**The Questioner:** What do you advise me?

**The Sheikh:** **The safest** is to use Islamic bank cards, which charge fixed fees instead of interest.

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf

<div class="scene-box">

**📖 Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyya's Position on Money Changing**

*Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyya رحمه الله was asked about money changers who lend to people with a surplus...*

**Ibn Taymiyya رحمه الله:**
> This is the **riba** upon whose prohibition the Ummah has agreed, and it is among the **greatest sins**. The Prophet ﷺ cursed the one who consumes riba, the one who pays it, the one who writes it, and its witnesses.

Then he رحمه الله said:
> As for the one who gives a **benevolent loan** without a condition of surplus, this is among the **best of deeds**, and he has a great reward with Allah.

**The lesson:** The fundamental difference between a benevolent loan and riba is **the conditioned surplus**.

</div>

---

<div class="scene-box">

**📖 The Beginning of Islamic Banks - An Inspiring Story**

*In 1963, in the village of Mit Ghamr in Egypt...*

**Dr. Ahmad An-Najjar** (founder of the first Islamic banking experiment):
> I saw **farmers** needing financing to buy seeds and equipment, and they found nothing but **riba**.
>
> I said to myself: Why don't we create a bank that finances through **Mudaraba and Musharaka**?

**The narrator:**
The experiment succeeded and spread throughout the Muslim world. Today, the volume of Islamic finance **exceeds $3 trillion**.

**The lesson:** Islamic alternatives are **possible and successful**, but they need determination and creativity.

</div>

---

<div class="scene-box">

**📖 The Decision of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy**

*In 1986, the International Islamic Fiqh Academy issued its historic decision...*

**Text of the decision:**
> Any surplus or interest on a debt that has come due and the debtor cannot repay in exchange for its postponement, as well as the surplus or interest on the loan from the beginning of the contract, **these two forms are riba forbidden by Sharia**.

**The lesson:** The collective fatwa of scholars is clear on the prohibition of bank interest.

</div>

---

### Case Four: Banking Tawarruq

<div class="case-box">

**💰 Case: Need for cash liquidity**

**Question:**
I need cash. The bank buys metals from the exchange then sells them to me on installments, then authorizes me to sell them immediately. What is the ruling?

**Answer:**
⚠️ **Disagreement among jurists:**

| Position | Opinion |
|----------|--------|

</div>

---

### Case Five: Usurious Car Loan "By Necessity"

<div class="case-box">

**🚗 Case: No Islamic financing available**

**Question:**
I need a car for work and there's no Islamic bank. Is it permissible to take a usurious loan by necessity?

**Answer:**
❌ **Principle: Usurious loans are forbidden**

- **Legal necessity** = What preserves life
- **Car for work** = Need, not necessity in legal sense

**Alternatives:**
- Save until cash purchase
- Buy a cheaper used car
- Rent instead of buying
- Benevolent loan from family or friends
- Look for Islamic bank in a neighboring city

💡 **Rule:** "Hardship does not permit the categorically forbidden"

</div>

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Question for Reflection**

> Allah says: ﴾O you who believe! Fear Allah and give up what remains of riba if you are believers ۝ And if you do not, then be warned of war from Allah and His Messenger﴿
>
> [Al-Baqara: 278-279]

**Reflect:**

1️⃣ Why is the punishment for consuming riba so severe?

2️⃣ How do usurious transactions affect the individual and society?

3️⃣ What is the role of the Muslim in supporting and developing Islamic alternatives?

**Remember:**
> The Prophet ﷺ said: "Riba has 73 doors, the least of which is like a man marrying his own mother"
>
> Making light of usurious transactions "by necessity" without seeking alternatives is serious negligence.

**What can you do?**
- Support Islamic banks by dealing with them
- Spread awareness of Sharia-compliant alternatives
- Advocate for establishing Islamic financial institutions in your country
- Teach your children the difference between halal and haram in money
