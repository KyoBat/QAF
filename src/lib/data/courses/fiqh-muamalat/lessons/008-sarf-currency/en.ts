## The Legitimacy of Currency Exchange

### From the Prophetic Sunna
> 'Ubada ibn as-Samit رضي الله عنه reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: "Gold for gold, silver for silver... like for like, equal for equal, hand to hand. If these types differ, sell as you wish, as long as it is hand to hand." [Reported by Muslim]

### Consensus
Scholars are unanimous on the permissibility of currency exchange according to its legal conditions.

## Conditions for the Validity of Currency Exchange

### First Condition: Immediate Exchange in the Session

**The evidence:**
> The Prophet ﷺ said: "Hand to hand." [Reported by Muslim]

> The Prophet ﷺ said: "Do not sell gold for gold except like for like, do not favor one over another, and do not sell absent for present." [Agreed upon]

**Meaning of immediate exchange:**
- Each party receives their compensation before separating
- It is not permitted to delay either compensation

**Applications:**
- Exchanging currencies at a money exchange office: delivery must be immediate
- Bank transfer: money must arrive the same day

### Second Condition: Equality if the Type is the Same

**The evidence:**
> The Prophet ﷺ said: "Gold for gold... like for like." [Reported by Muslim]

**Its application:**
- Gold for gold: equality in weight is obligatory
- Riyal for riyal: equality in value is obligatory

**Exception:**
- If the type differs: surplus is permitted
- Example: dollar for euro — surplus is permitted with immediate exchange

## Rules for Exchanging Gold and Silver

### Exchanging Gold for Gold

| Condition | Ruling |
|-----------|--------|

| Immediate exchange | Obligatory |

**Example:**

- Selling ten grams of gold for nine — prohibited (surplus usury)

### Exchanging Silver for Silver

- Equality and immediate exchange are obligatory

### Exchanging Gold for Silver

## Paper Currencies and Their Ruling

### Are paper currencies like gold and silver?

**The preponderant view:**
Paper currencies have the ruling of the two metals (gold and silver) regarding:
- The obligation of zakat
- The application of usury
- The obligation of immediate exchange in currency exchange

**The evidence:**
- The cause in gold and silver is monetary value
- Paper currencies are the price of things
- So they take the ruling of gold and silver

### Decisions of Jurisprudential Assemblies

> The International Islamic Fiqh Academy decided:
> "Paper currencies are conventional money having full monetary character, and they have the legal rulings established for gold and silver regarding the rules of usury, zakat, salam, and all their other rulings."

## Constructive Exchange

### Its Definition
> The constructive receipt that takes the place of actual receipt.

### Its Contemporary Forms

**1. Certified check:**
- Considered receipt according to many scholars
- Because the exchange is guaranteed

**2. Bank transfer:**
- Valid if done in the same session
- Or if it enters the recipient's account immediately

**3. ATM:**
- Considered receipt because it is immediate delivery

**4. Transfer applications:**
- If the transfer is immediate: permitted
- If the transfer is delayed: not permitted

---

## Contemporary Issues in Currency Exchange

### 1. Buying Currencies Online

**The ruling:**
- Permitted if constructive receipt is achieved
- By the amount entering the buyer's account immediately

### 2. Currency Trading (Forex)

**Its problems:**
- Generally immediate exchange is not achieved
- It contains prohibited forward contracts
- It contains leverage (usurious loan)

**The ruling:**
- Most forms of Forex are prohibited
- Due to the usury and uncertainty they contain

### 3. Currency Conversion with Fees

**The ruling:**
- It is permitted to take fees for the transfer service
- Fees are remuneration for work, not for the exchange

### 4. Difference in Exchange Rate

**The ruling:**
- Exchange at market price is permitted
- Increase in exchange for delay is not permitted

## Selling in One Currency and Paying in Another

### The Situation
Buying merchandise in dollars and paying the price in riyals

### The Ruling
- Permitted at the price of the day of payment
- Not at the price of the day of purchase if it is different

### The Evidence
> Ibn 'Umar said: We used to sell camels for dinars and take dirhams, and for dirhams and take dinars. The Prophet ﷺ said: "No problem taking them at the day's price, as long as you do not separate with something remaining between you." [Reported by Ahmad and Abu Dawud]
