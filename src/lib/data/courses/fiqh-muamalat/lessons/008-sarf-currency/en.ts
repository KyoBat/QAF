<div class="scene-box">

**📖 The Scene: The Money Changers' Market — Medina in the Prophet's Era ﷺ**

*A merchant comes to Abdullah ibn Umar at the market...*

**The Merchant**: O Abu Abd ar-Rahman! I sell camels at al-Baqi', I sell in dinars and take dirhams, and I sell in dirhams and take dinars!

**Ibn Umar** *(reflecting)*: No problem...

**The Merchant** *(surprised)*: And what is the condition?

**Ibn Umar**: That you take them **at today's rate**, and **provided you don't part with something remaining between you!**

*The man goes to confirm with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ...*

**The Prophet ﷺ**: **"No problem taking them at today's rate as long as you don't part with something remaining between you."**

**The Narrator**: *This was the fundamental rule of currency exchange: immediate taking of possession at the day's rate!*

## Definition of Currency Exchange (Sarf)

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Linguistic and Technical Meaning**

**Linguistically**: As-Sarf means returning and converting, hence the exchange of dirhams means their conversion.

**In legal terminology**: The sale of money for money, whether of the same type or different types.

</div>

## Legitimacy of Currency Exchange

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 The Proof from Sunnah**

> From 'Ubadah ibn as-Samit, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:
> **"Gold for gold, silver for silver... equal for equal, like for like, hand to hand. If these types differ, sell as you wish provided it is hand to hand."**
> — Narrated by Muslim

</div>

### The Consensus

Scholars are unanimous on the permissibility of currency exchange with its legal conditions. It is a necessary transaction to facilitate trade between nations.

## Conditions for Valid Currency Exchange

<!-- DIAGRAM:sarf-conditions -->

### First Condition: Taking Possession in the Session

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Proof for Taking Possession**

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Hand to hand."**
> — Narrated by Muslim

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Do not sell gold for gold except equal for equal, do not let one part exceed the other, and do not sell the absent for the present."**
> — Agreed Upon

</div>

<div class="scene-box">

**📖 What Does Taking Possession Mean?**

**The exchange office employee**: I want 500 dollars.

**The customer** *(taking out the riyals)*: Here are 1875 riyals.

**The employee** *(handing him the dollars)*: Here are 500 dollars.

✅ **Valid possession** — Both received before parting.

---

**Another customer**: I want 1000 dollars, but the riyals will arrive tomorrow!

**The employee**: Sorry, impossible. **Delivery must be immediate!**

❌ **Delay is not permitted** — This is riba an-nasi'ah.

</div>

### Second Condition: Equality if the Type is Identical

<div class="scene-box">

**📖 When is Equality Required?**

**Example ①**: Riyal for riyal
- 100 riyals = 100 riyals ✅
- 100 riyals ≠ 95 riyals ❌ (riba al-fadl)

**Example ②**: Dollar for euro
- 100 dollars = 90 euros ✅ (surplus is allowed)
- Because the type is different!

</div>

---

## Rules for Gold and Silver Exchange

<!-- DIAGRAM:sarf-gold-silver-table -->

<div class="scene-box">

**📖 At the Jeweler's**

**The Customer**: I want to exchange 50 grams of 21 karat gold for 18 karat gold.

**The Jeweler**: Okay! I'll give you 55 grams of 18 karat for your 50.

**⚠️ This is riba al-fadl!** Gold for gold must be equal in **weight**, regardless of karat.

**✅ The Correct Method**:
1. Sell the old gold for cash
2. Buy the new gold for cash

</div>

## Paper Currency and Its Ruling

### Do Paper Currencies Have the Same Ruling as Gold and Silver?

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 The Preponderant View**

Paper currencies have the ruling of the two precious metals (gold and silver) regarding:
- The obligation of zakat
- The application of usury rules
- The obligation of taking possession in exchange

**The Cause**: Monetary value — paper currencies are a price for things, so they take the ruling of gold and silver.

</div>

### Fiqh Council Decisions

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 International Islamic Fiqh Council Decision**

> "Paper currencies are conventional currencies having the full characteristic of monetary value. They have the legal rulings established for gold and silver regarding usury, zakat, salam, and all their other rules."

</div>

## Selling in One Currency and Payment in Another

<div class="scene-box">

**📖 At the Market**

**The Merchant**: This merchandise costs 100 dollars.

**The Buyer**: I don't have dollars, but I have riyals!

**The Merchant**: No problem, pay in riyals at today's rate!

✅ **Permitted** — provided payment is **at the rate of the day of payment**, not the rate of the day of agreement.

</div>

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 The Prophetic Proof**

> Ibn Umar said: We used to sell camels in dinars and take dirhams, and in dirhams and take dinars.
> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"No problem taking them at today's rate as long as you don't part with something remaining between you."**
> — Narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawud

## 📖 From the Righteous Predecessors: The Precision of the Companions

<div class="scene-box">

**📖 At al-Baqi' Market — Medina**

*A merchant questions Ibn Umar...*

**The Merchant**: O Abu Abd ar-Rahman, I sell in dinars and receive in dirhams!

**Ibn Umar**: How do you do it?

**The Merchant**: He buys from me for ten dinars, and gives me a hundred dirhams.

**Ibn Umar** *(warning)*: Be careful about two things:

**First**: Take them **at today's rate** — not yesterday's or tomorrow's!

**Second**: **Don't part with something remaining between you** — nothing should remain owed to you!

**The Merchant**: I understand! Now and here, not later!

**Ibn Umar** *(smiling)*: Excellent! This is how the Messenger of Allah ﷺ taught us.

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases: Is This Exchange Valid?

### Case 1: Traditional Currency Exchange Office

<div class="scene-box">

**❓ The Question**

I went to the currency exchange office to convert 1000 dollars to riyals.

The employee gave me the riyals immediately and took the dollars.

Is this permitted?

</div>

**The Answer**: 

✅ **Permitted** — This is a valid exchange because:
- Taking possession occurred in the session
- Both counter-values were delivered before parting
- Nothing was delayed

---

### Case 2: International Bank Transfer

<div class="scene-box">

**❓ The Question**

I want to transfer money to my family in another country.

The bank takes the amount in riyals and deposits in their account in local currency.

Is this permitted?

</div>

**The Answer**: 

✅ **Permitted** — provided that:
- The amount is deposited in the recipient's account **immediately** or **the same business day**
- Constructive possession (money entering the account) replaces physical possession

---

### Case 3: Buying Cryptocurrency

<div class="scene-box">

**❓ The Question**

I bought Bitcoin through a trading platform.

I paid in riyals and received the Bitcoin in my digital wallet immediately.

Is this permitted?

</div>

**The Answer**: 

⚠️ **Subject of contemporary disagreement** —
- If cryptocurrencies are considered money, immediate taking of possession is required (achieved here)
- But the status of cryptocurrencies themselves is a matter of major disagreement among contemporary scholars
- Some have permitted them, others have prohibited them

---

### Case 4: Forex (Currency Trading)

<div class="scene-box">

**❓ The Question**

I opened an account on a Forex platform to trade currencies.

I buy and sell and make profits.

Is this lawful?

</div>

**The Answer**: 

❌ **Generally prohibited** — due to several legal violations:

<!-- DIAGRAM:sarf-forex-violations -->

**The Legal Alternative**: A true Islamic platform without leverage or interest with immediate taking of possession.

---

### Case 5: Money Transfer (Western Union)

<div class="scene-box">

**❓ The Question**

I sent money via Western Union.

The sender pays in dollars and the recipient receives in local currency after a few days.

Is this permitted?

</div>

**The Answer**: 

✅ **Permitted** — because it's a **hawala (transfer), not a currency exchange!**

| Currency Exchange | Hawala (Transfer) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Sale of money for money | Transfer of debt from one person to another |
| Taking possession required | Taking possession not required |
| Sale transaction | Mutual assistance transaction |

Hawala is legally permitted, and the exchange happens at the moment of receipt at the day's rate.

## 💡 Stop and Reflect

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 A Magnificent Prophetic Statement**

> **"Hand to hand"** — The Prophet ﷺ

This simple statement carries a magnificent rule to protect the economy from manipulation and illusory speculation!

</div>

**Reflect with me**:

🔹 How many global economic crises are caused by credit transactions and futures contracts without real taking of possession?

🔹 When you transfer your money, do you make sure the recipient receives it immediately?

🔹 If the world followed the rule of **"hand to hand"** in financial transactions, what would the global economy look like?

**Remember**: Sharia protects **wealth** from loss and uncertainty before protecting **profits**!
