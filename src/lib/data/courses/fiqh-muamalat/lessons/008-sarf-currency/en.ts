## Definition of Currency Exchange (Sarf)

### Linguistic Meaning
Sarf: returning and converting, from which comes exchanging dirhams, meaning converting them.

### Technical Meaning
> The sale of money for money, whether of the same type or of different types.

## The Legitimacy of Currency Exchange

### From the Prophetic Sunna
> 'Ubada ibn as-Samit رضي الله عنه reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: "Gold for gold, silver for silver... like for like, equal for equal, hand to hand. If these types differ, sell as you wish, as long as it is hand to hand." [Reported by Muslim]

### Consensus
Scholars are unanimous on the permissibility of currency exchange according to its legal conditions.

---

## Conditions for the Validity of Currency Exchange

### First Condition: Immediate Exchange in the Session

**The evidence:**
> The Prophet ﷺ said: "Hand to hand." [Reported by Muslim]

> The Prophet ﷺ said: "Do not sell gold for gold except like for like, do not favor one over another, and do not sell absent for present." [Agreed upon]

**Meaning of immediate exchange:**
- Each party receives their compensation before separating
- It is not permitted to delay either compensation

**Applications:**
- Exchanging currencies at a money exchange office: delivery must be immediate
- Bank transfer: money must arrive the same day

### Second Condition: Equality if the Type is the Same

**The evidence:**
> The Prophet ﷺ said: "Gold for gold... like for like." [Reported by Muslim]

**Its application:**
- Gold for gold: equality in weight is obligatory
- Riyal for riyal: equality in value is obligatory

**Exception:**
- If the type differs: surplus is permitted
- Example: dollar for euro — surplus is permitted with immediate exchange

## Rules for Exchanging Gold and Silver

### Exchanging Gold for Gold

| Condition | Ruling |
|-----------|--------|
| Equality | Obligatory |
| Immediate exchange | Obligatory |

**Example:**
- Selling ten grams of gold for ten grams of gold — permitted
- Selling ten grams of gold for nine — prohibited (surplus usury)

### Exchanging Silver for Silver

- Same rules as gold for gold
- Equality and immediate exchange are obligatory

### Exchanging Gold for Silver

| Condition | Ruling |
|-----------|--------|
| Equality | Not obligatory (surplus is permitted) |
| Immediate exchange | Obligatory |

---

## Paper Currencies and Their Ruling

### Are paper currencies like gold and silver?

**The preponderant view:**
Paper currencies have the ruling of the two metals (gold and silver) regarding:
- The obligation of zakat
- The application of usury
- The obligation of immediate exchange in currency exchange

**The evidence:**
- The cause in gold and silver is monetary value
- Paper currencies are the price of things
- So they take the ruling of gold and silver

### Decisions of Jurisprudential Assemblies

> The International Islamic Fiqh Academy decided:
> "Paper currencies are conventional money having full monetary character, and they have the legal rulings established for gold and silver regarding the rules of usury, zakat, salam, and all their other rulings."

## Exchange of Different Currencies

### The General Rule

| Case | Equality | Immediate exchange |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| Same currency (riyal for riyal) | Obligatory | Obligatory |
| Different currencies (dollar for euro) | Not obligatory | Obligatory |

### Practical Examples

**1. Exchanging riyal for riyal:**
- Equality is obligatory: one hundred for one hundred
- Immediate exchange is obligatory: delay is not permitted

**2. Exchanging dollar for euro:**
- Surplus is permitted: according to the exchange rate
- Immediate exchange is obligatory: delay is not permitted

**3. Exchanging gold for dollars:**

- Immediate exchange is obligatory: delay is not permitted

---

## Constructive Exchange

### Its Definition
> The constructive receipt that takes the place of actual receipt.

### Its Contemporary Forms

**1. Certified check:**
- Considered receipt according to many scholars
- Because the exchange is guaranteed

**2. Bank transfer:**
- Valid if done in the same session
- Or if it enters the recipient's account immediately

**3. ATM:**
- Considered receipt because it is immediate delivery

**4. Transfer applications:**
- If the transfer is immediate: permitted
- If the transfer is delayed: not permitted

---

## Contemporary Issues in Currency Exchange

### 1. Buying Currencies Online

**The ruling:**
- Permitted if constructive receipt is achieved
- By the amount entering the buyer's account immediately

### 2. Currency Trading (Forex)

**Its problems:**
- Generally immediate exchange is not achieved
- It contains prohibited forward contracts
- It contains leverage (usurious loan)

**The ruling:**
- Most forms of Forex are prohibited
- Due to the usury and uncertainty they contain

### 3. Currency Conversion with Fees

**The ruling:**
- It is permitted to take fees for the transfer service
- Fees are remuneration for work, not for the exchange

### 4. Difference in Exchange Rate

**The ruling:**
- Exchange at market price is permitted
- Increase in exchange for delay is not permitted

## Selling in One Currency and Paying in Another

### The Situation
Buying merchandise in dollars and paying the price in riyals

### The Ruling
- Permitted at the price of the day of payment
- Not at the price of the day of purchase if it is different

### The Evidence
> Ibn 'Umar said: We used to sell camels for dinars and take dirhams, and for dirhams and take dinars. The Prophet ﷺ said: "No problem taking them at the day's price, as long as you do not separate with something remaining between you." [Reported by Ahmad and Abu Dawud]

---

## The Legal Guidelines for Currency Exchange

1. **Immediate exchange** — No delay for either compensation
2. **Equality in the same type** — No surplus in the same currency
3. **No uncertainty** — Knowledge of the exchange rate
4. **No invalid condition** — Like requiring guaranteed profit
5. **No monopoly** — No market control

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf: The Precision of the Companions in Currency Exchange

It is narrated that a man came to 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar رضي الله عنهما in the market and said:

**"O Abu 'Abd ar-Rahman, I sell camels at al-Baqi'. I sell for dinars and take dirhams, and I sell for dirhams and take dinars!"**

Ibn 'Umar رضي الله عنه said:

> **"No problem taking them at the day's price, as long as you do not separate with something remaining between you."**

Then the man went to the Prophet ﷺ and asked him, and he answered him the same as Ibn 'Umar said.

The Companions رضي الله عنهم were keen on:
- **Immediate exchange** — they would not separate except after the exchange was complete
- **The day's price** — they would not defer the exchange at an old price
- **Complete clarity** — no ambiguity in the amounts

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### Case 1: Traditional Money Exchange

**Question:** I went to a money exchange office to convert 1000 dollars to riyals. The employee gave me the riyals immediately and took the dollars. Is this permitted?

**Answer:** ✅ **Permitted** — this is valid exchange because immediate exchange occurred in the session. Both compensations were delivered before separation.

---

### Case 2: International Bank Transfer

**Question:** I want to transfer an amount to my family in another country. The bank takes the amount in riyals and deposits it in their account in local currency. Is this permitted?

**Answer:** ✅ **Permitted** — if the amount is deposited in the recipient's account immediately or on the same business day. Constructive receipt (money entering the account) takes the place of actual receipt.

---

### Case 3: Buying Cryptocurrencies

**Question:** I bought Bitcoin through a trading platform, paid in riyals and received the Bitcoin in my digital wallet immediately. Is this permitted?

**Answer:** ⚠️ **There is disagreement** — if cryptocurrencies are considered money, then immediate exchange is required (which is achieved here). But the ruling on cryptocurrencies themselves is disputed among contemporary scholars.

---

### Case 4: Forex (Currency Trading)

**Question:** I opened an account on a Forex platform for currency trading. I buy and sell and make profits. Is this lawful?

**Answer:** ❌ **Generally prohibited** — for several reasons:
- **No immediate exchange:** transactions are mostly deferred
- **Leverage:** a disguised usurious loan
- **Rollover fees:** explicit usury

The alternative: If an Islamic platform exists without leverage or interest with real immediate exchange, it may be permitted.

---

### Case 5: Money Transfer (Western Union)

**Question:** I sent money through Western Union. The sender pays in dollars and the recipient collects in their country's currency days later. Is this permitted?

**Answer:** ✅ **Permitted** — this is a transfer (hawala), not exchange. Transfer is moving a debt from one responsibility to another, which is legally permitted. The exchange occurs at collection at the day's rate.

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

> **"Hand to hand"** — The Prophet ﷺ

This simple prophetic phrase carries a great principle in protecting the economy from manipulation and speculative bubbles.

Reflect:

🔹 How many global economic crises were caused by dealing in debts and forward contracts without real exchange?

🔹 When transferring your money, do you ensure the recipient receives the amount immediately?

🔹 If the world adhered to the rule of "hand to hand" in financial transactions, what would the global economy look like?

**Remember:** The Shariah protects wealth from loss and uncertainty before it protects profits.
