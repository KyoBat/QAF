## 📖 Stories from the Salaf

### The Pledging of the Prophet's Armor ﷺ

**Aisha رضي الله عنها** narrated:

> "The Messenger of Allah ﷺ died while his armor was pledged with a Jew for thirty sa' of barley."

**Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim**

Imam **Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani** رحمه الله commented:

> "The hadith shows the permissibility of dealing with non-Muslims in what is not specifically forbidden, and the permissibility of pledging war equipment to a non-Muslim, and that this is not considered the prohibited alliance."

**The lesson:**
- The humility of the Prophet ﷺ and his asceticism in this world
- Permissibility of pledge for necessity, even with a non-Muslim
- That loans are legitimate even from the rich to the poor

---

### Abu Bakr al-Siddiq's Loan رضي الله عنه

When the Prophet ﷺ migrated with **Abu Bakr al-Siddiq رضي الله عنه**, Abu Bakr bought two riding camels for the journey.

The Prophet ﷺ said: "**With its price.**"

Meaning: I will only accept it with its price.

**The lesson:** The Prophet ﷺ wanted the loan to be clear and not mixed with gift, and this is from the perfection of clarity in financial dealings.

---

### The Excellent Repayment of Abdullah ibn Umar

**Abdullah ibn Umar رضي الله عنهما** would, whenever he borrowed money from someone, return it better than what he took.

When asked about this, he said:

> "I heard the Prophet ﷺ say: The best of you are those who are best in repaying."

**The lesson:** Surplus at repayment without stipulation is from noble character and is not usury.

**Answer:** ✅ **Permissible and recommended** and among the best acts of worship:

### Case Two: Pledging a Car for a Loan

**Question:** My friend wants a loan of 30,000 riyals. I asked him to pledge his car until he pays. Is it permissible for me to drive the car?

**Answer:** ❌ **Not permissible** to drive the pledged car:
- The pledge is a trust with you
- Benefiting from the pledge = loan generating benefit = usury

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

> **Question for reflection:**
>
> The Prophet ﷺ died while his armor was pledged, although he could have done without borrowing.
>
> - What do we learn from his humility ﷺ in financial dealings?
> - How do we balance between self-sufficiency and dealing with people properly?
> - Does the interest-free loan in our time fulfill its role as it did in the time of the Salaf?
>
> **Reflect:** "Whoever relieves a believer of a hardship from the hardships of this world, Allah will relieve him of a hardship from the hardships of the Day of Resurrection."
