<div class="scene-box">

**📖 Scene: Medina — The Last Days of the Prophet's Life ﷺ**

*In the modest house of Aisha رضي الله عنها, walls of clay and roof of palm leaves... The Prophet ﷺ in his final illness, and his armor is not with him...*

**Aisha رضي الله عنها:** *(after his death ﷺ, narrating to the Tabi'in)*
The Messenger of Allah ﷺ passed away **while his armor was pledged with a Jew for thirty saa' of barley**.

**The Tabi'i:** *(astonished)*
The master of creation, the noblest of humans, dies with his armor pledged?!

**Aisha رضي الله عنها:** *(with tearful eyes)*
Yes, and the family of Muhammad never ate barley bread to satisfaction two days in a row until he passed away.

*This is detachment from the world... And this is the legitimacy of pledge and loan out of necessity, even if the borrower is the best of creation ﷺ.*

## Part One: The Loan (Qard Hassan)

### Definition of Loan

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Juristic Definition**

**Linguistically:**
Qard (loan): **Cutting**, because the lender cuts a portion of his wealth to give to the borrower.

**Technically:**
> **Giving property to someone to benefit from it and return its equivalent**
>
> That is: transferring ownership of property on condition of returning its equivalent.

</div>

### Legitimacy and Merit of the Loan

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 From the Quran**

> Allah says: ﴾Who is it that will lend Allah a goodly loan? He will multiply it for him many times﴿ [Al-Baqarah: 245]

**From the Sunnah:**
> Abu Hurayra رضي الله عنه narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said: **"Whoever relieves a believer of a hardship of this world, Allah will relieve him of a hardship on the Day of Resurrection."** [Muslim]

</div>

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 The Great Merit of the Loan**

> Ibn Mas'ud رضي الله عنه narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said:
>
> **"Any Muslim who lends another Muslim twice, it is like giving charity once."**
>
> [Ibn Majah]

**Why is the loan sometimes better than charity?**
Because the borrower takes it out of need and returns it, which better preserves his dignity.

### Extra in Repayment

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 The Golden Rule**

> **Every loan that generates a benefit is usury (Riba)**

**⚠️ Note:** This is a **jurisprudential rule (qa'ida fiqhiyya)** derived from the statements of the Companions and Followers, not a prophetic hadith. There is consensus on its meaning, and it is based on narrations from several Companions including: Ibn Mas'ud, Ubayy ibn Ka'b, Ibn Abbas, and Abdullah ibn Salam (may Allah be pleased with them).

</div>

<!-- DIAGRAM:qard-surplus-rules -->

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Proof of Legitimacy of Voluntary Extra**

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"The best of you are those who are best in repaying."** [Bukhari and Muslim]

And the Prophet ﷺ, when he borrowed, would repay better than what he took.

## Part Two: The Pledge (Rahn)

<div class="scene-box">

**📖 Scene: The Market of Medina — In the Prophet's Time ﷺ**

*The Prophet ﷺ needs food for his family, and goes to a Jew selling barley...*

**The Prophet ﷺ:** O so-and-so, sell me thirty saa' of barley on credit.

**The Jew:** *(with a merchant's caution)*
Do you have something to pledge?

**The Prophet ﷺ:** My armor.

**The Jew:** *(astonished)*
Your armor?! The Prophet's armor?!

**The Prophet ﷺ:** Yes, take it as security until I repay.

*And the armor remained with the Jew until the Prophet ﷺ passed away... This is the pledge: securing a debt with property.*

</div>

### Definition of Pledge

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Juristic Definition**

**Linguistically:**
Permanence and stability, hence Allah's saying: ﴾Every soul is held in pledge for what it has earned﴿ [Al-Muddaththir: 38]

**Technically:**
> **Securing a debt with property from which one can recover it or from its price in case of non-payment**
>
> That is: placing something of value as security for the debt.

</div>

<!-- DIAGRAM:rahn-contract -->

### Legitimacy of the Pledge

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 From the Quran**

> Allah says: ﴾And if you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then a pledge in hand﴿ [Al-Baqarah: 283]

**From the Sunnah:**
> Aisha رضي الله عنها said: **"The Prophet ﷺ bought food from a Jew and pledged his armor to him."** [Bukhari and Muslim]

**The Consensus:**
Scholars are unanimous on the permissibility of pledge in travel and at home.

### The Creditor's Use of the Pledge

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 The Golden Rule**

> **The creditor may not use the pledged item**
>
> Because it is a loan that generates benefit = Riba

</div>

<!-- DIAGRAM:rahn-mortgagee-use -->

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Proof of the Animal Exception**

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"A riding animal may be ridden in proportion to its maintenance if it is pledged, and milk may be drunk in proportion to maintenance if the animal is pledged. Whoever rides and drinks must provide maintenance."**
>
> [Bukhari]

**The wisdom:** The animal needs maintenance, so whoever maintains it may benefit in proportion.

### Selling the Pledge Upon Non-Payment

<div class="case-box">

**What Happens if the Pledger Doesn't Repay?**

1️⃣ **Grace period for the insolvent** - The pledge is not sold immediately if incapable ﴾If he is in difficulty, grant respite until ease﴿

2️⃣ **Request payment from the pledger** - If he is capable

3️⃣ **If he refuses while capable** - He is forced to sell or the judge sells

4️⃣ **The debt is recovered from the pledge's price**

5️⃣ **Any surplus goes to the pledger** - If the price exceeds the debt, the difference goes to the pledger

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf

<div class="scene-box">

**📖 The Prophet's Armor ﷺ Pledged**

*After the Prophet ﷺ passed away, in an assembly of his companions رضي الله عنهم...*

**Abu Bakr As-Siddiq رضي الله عنه:** *(inquiring)*
Where is the Messenger of Allah's ﷺ armor?

**Aisha رضي الله عنها:**
Pledged with a Jew for thirty saa' of barley.

**Abu Bakr رضي الله عنه:** *(with tears in his eyes)*
Glory be to Allah! The master of creation, the best of humans, dies with his armor pledged! By Allah, he detached from this world like no one else.

**The lesson:**
- Permissibility of pledge out of necessity, even with a non-Muslim
- The Prophet's ﷺ humility and detachment from the world
- Legitimacy of borrowing even for the wealthy when in need

</div>

---

<div class="scene-box">

**📖 Abdullah ibn Umar's Beautiful Repayment**

*Abdullah ibn Umar رضي الله عنهما was among the most scrupulous...*

**The Narrator:**
Abdullah ibn Umar رضي الله عنهما, when he borrowed money from someone, would return **better than what he took**.

**He was asked:**
Why do you add, O Abu Abdurrahman?

**Ibn Umar:**
I heard the Prophet ﷺ say: **"The best of you are those who are best in repaying."**

**The lesson:**
Voluntary extra upon repayment is from noble character and is not usury.

</div>

<div class="scene-box">

**📖 Abu Bakr's Loan to the Prophet ﷺ During the Hijra**

*When the Prophet ﷺ wanted to emigrate, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq رضي الله عنه prepared two riding animals...*

**Abu Bakr رضي الله عنه:**
O Messenger of Allah, here is your mount.

**The Prophet ﷺ:** *(refusing)*
**For a price.**

**Abu Bakr:** O Messenger of Allah, it is yours!

**The Prophet ﷺ:**
No, **for a price**. I will not accept it except for its price.

**The lesson:**
The Prophet ﷺ wanted matters to be clear: either a loan to be repaid, or a sale at a price. Loans don't mix with gifts.

</div>

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### Case One: Loan for Marriage

<div class="case-box">

**💍 Case: Lending to a brother for marriage**

**Question:** My brother wants to get married but can't afford it. I want to lend him $50,000 to be repaid in 2 years. Is this permissible?

**Answer:** ✅ **Permissible and recommended — one of the best deeds**

### Case Two: Using the Pledged Car

<div class="case-box">

**🚗 Case: Can I drive the pledged car?**

**Question:** My friend wants a loan of $30,000. I asked him to pledge his car until he repays. Can I drive the car?

**Answer:** ❌ **No, it is forbidden to drive the pledged car**

- The pledge is a trust with you

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Question for Reflection**

The Prophet ﷺ died with his armor pledged, although he could have avoided borrowing.

**Reflect on these meanings:**

1️⃣ Why did the Prophet ﷺ choose to borrow when he had wealthy companions who would have given him everything?

2️⃣ What lesson is there in the armor remaining pledged until his death ﷺ?

3️⃣ How does this teach us to handle debts and financial needs?

**The answer:**
- Borrowing preserves dignity better than asking
- Clarity in financial transactions is from the Sunnah
- Detachment from the world doesn't mean abandoning lawful transactions
- The pledge is a legitimate guarantee that preserves both parties' rights
