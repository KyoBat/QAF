<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 The Scene: The Trading Caravans of Quraysh — Mecca before the Revelation**

*In the house of Khadija bint Khuwaylid, may Allah be pleased with her, one of the noble women of Quraysh and the wealthiest among them...*

**Maysara** *(Khadija's servant)*: O my lady, there is in Mecca a young man called Muhammad ibn Abdullah, they call him **the Truthful, the Trustworthy**!

**Khadija**: And what about him?

**Maysara**: People entrust him with their wealth, and he has never betrayed anyone! And he is skilled in trade.

**Khadija** *(reflecting)*: I want him to go with my wealth to Syria to trade, and I will give him more than I give others...

**The Narrator**: *So Muhammad ﷺ went with Khadija's wealth to Syria, and returned with profits she had never seen before. This was a **mudaraba** — the capital from Khadija and the labor from Muhammad ﷺ!*

## Definition of Mudaraba

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Linguistic and Technical Meaning**

**Linguistically**: Mudaraba comes from **"darb fil-ard"** (striking the earth), meaning traveling for trade. Allah says: ﴿And others who travel through the land, seeking Allah's bounty﴾

**In legal terminology**: A profit-sharing partnership contract between the capital owner and the worker, where the capital owner gives his money to the worker to trade with, and the profit is shared according to what they agree upon.

**Alternative name**: Also called **Qirad** in the language of the people of Hijaz.

## Legitimacy of Mudaraba

### From the Quran

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Proofs from the Book**

> ﴿There is no sin upon you to seek bounty from your Lord﴾
> — Al-Baqara: 198

> ﴿And others who travel through the land, seeking Allah's bounty﴾
> — Al-Muzzammil: 20

</div>

### From the Prophetic Sunnah

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Proofs from the Sunnah**

> It is reported that **Al-'Abbas ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib**, may Allah be pleased with him, when he gave money in mudaraba, stipulated to his partner:
> - **Not to travel by sea with it**
> - **Not to descend into a valley with it**
> - **Not to buy any animal with it (lit.: anything with a moist liver)**
> If he did so, he would be liable. **These conditions reached the Messenger of Allah ﷺ who approved them.**
> — Narrated by al-Bayhaqi

</div>

<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 The Story of Al-'Abbas's Conditions — Smart Protection of Capital**

*Al-'Abbas ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib, may Allah be pleased with him — the Prophet's ﷺ uncle — was among the wealthy of Quraysh and the most knowledgeable in trade...*

**Al-'Abbas** *(giving his money to a young trader)*: Take this money and trade with it, and the profit is between us. But I have conditions!

**The trader**: What are they, O uncle of the Messenger of Allah?

**Al-'Abbas**: 
- **Do not travel by sea with it** — for the sea has the risk of drowning!
- **Do not descend into a valley with it** — for valleys have the risk of floods!
- **Do not buy any animal with it** — meaning animals that might die!

**The trader**: And if I do?

**Al-'Abbas**: **If you do that, you will be liable!**

**The Narrator**: *Al-'Abbas's conditions reached the Messenger of Allah ﷺ... and he approved them!*

</div>

### The Consensus

The Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, are unanimous on the permissibility of mudaraba. The orphans of 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar and 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud would give their wealth in mudaraba.

### Reason

The need calls for mudaraba:
- The capital owner may **not know how to trade**
- The worker may **not have capital**
- In mudaraba there is **combination of both interests**!

## The Pillars of Mudaraba

<!-- DIAGRAM:mudarabah-pillars -->

### First Pillar: The Capital

<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 Conditions of the Capital**

**① That it be in cash**
- It cannot be in goods according to the majority
- Wisdom: ease of evaluating profit and loss

**② That it be known**
- Known quantity: 100,000 riyals ✅
- Known type: dollar or riyal ✅

**③ That it be specified**
- Not a debt
- Pointed to or delivered

**④ That it be delivered to the worker**
- So he can dispose of it freely
- It does not remain under the capital owner's hand

</div>

### Second Pillar: The Work

| Condition | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| That it be lawful | Mudaraba in alcohol and gambling is forbidden |
| That the worker be independent | He has freedom to buy and sell |
| That it be in trade | Buying and selling, not manufacturing or agriculture according to the majority |

### Third Pillar: The Profit

<!-- DIAGRAM:mudarabah-profit-conditions -->

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 What Invalidates the Mudaraba**

**❌ Forbidden in profit sharing:**
- Setting a fixed amount for one of them
- Guaranteeing the capital to the worker
- Guaranteeing a fixed profit rate (e.g.: 10% annual guaranteed)

**The reason:** This transforms the mudaraba from a partnership into a usurious loan!

</div>

### Fourth Pillar: The Formula

**Mudaraba formulas:**
- "I give you this money in mudaraba"
- "Take this money and trade with it, and the profit is between us"
- Or what indicates that in word or deed

---

## Types of Mudaraba

<!-- DIAGRAM:mudarabah-types -->

### Free Mudaraba (Mutlaqa)

<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 Example of Free Mudaraba**

**Sa'id** *(the capital owner)*: Take this money and trade with it, and the profit is between us fifty-fifty.

**Khalid** *(the worker)*: In what type of trade?

**Sa'id**: Whatever you want! You know the market better.

**Khalid**: And may I travel with it?

**Sa'id**: Do what you see is in the best interest.

✅ **This is a free mudaraba** — the worker is free to dispose in all types of trade.

</div>

**Rules of free mudaraba:**
- The worker can trade in all types of commerce
- He can travel with the money
- He can sell cash or on credit according to custom

### Restricted Mudaraba (Muqayyada)

<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 Example of Restricted Mudaraba**

**Ahmad**: Take this money and trade with it, but with conditions:
- **Trade only in real estate**
- **Do not travel with the money outside the city**
- **Do not sell on credit**

**Muhammad**: And if I don't comply?

**Ahmad**: **If you don't comply, you will be liable!**

</div>

**Rule when conditions are violated:**
- If the worker violates the conditions, he is liable in case of loss
- Because he exceeded what the capital owner stipulated

---

## Rules of Mudaraba

### Distribution of Profit and Loss

<!-- DIAGRAM:mudarabah-profit-loss -->

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Golden Rule**

> **Profit protects the capital**

Meaning that profit first covers the loss, then what remains is shared.

**Example:** Capital 100,000 → Year 1 profit 20,000 → Year 2 loss 15,000
- Result: Net profit 5,000 to be shared according to agreement

</div>

### Guarantee in Mudaraba

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 The Fundamental Rule**

> **The worker is a trustee, he only guarantees in case of abuse or negligence**

</div>

| Type of breach | Example | Rule |
|----------------|---------|------|
| Abuse | Violating the owner's conditions | Liable |
| Abuse | Trading in the unlawful | Liable |
| Abuse | Lending the money to others | Liable |
| Negligence | Leaving the money unprotected | Liable |
| Negligence | Neglecting trade until goods spoiled | Liable |
| Without abuse | Market loss | Not liable |

### Expenses of Mudaraba

| Type of expense | Who bears it? |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Normal business expenses | The capital |
| Storage and transport rent | The capital |
| Employee salaries | The capital |
| Worker's personal expenses at home | His own funds |
| Worker's expenses while traveling | Disagreement (most correct: the capital) |

---

## Termination of Mudaraba

<!-- DIAGRAM:mudarabah-termination -->

### Liquidation Procedures

1. **Sell the goods** and convert to cash
2. **Collect outstanding debts**
3. **Calculate profit and loss** precisely
4. **Return the capital** to the owner first
5. **Divide the profit** according to agreement

## Difference Between Mudaraba and Usurious Loan

<!-- DIAGRAM:mudarabah-vs-riba -->

---

## 📖 From the Stories of the Salaf: The Mudaraba of Khadija and the Prophet ﷺ

<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 The Story of the Mudaraba That Changed History**

*Fifteen years before the Revelation, in Mecca...*

**Maysara** *(Khadija's servant)*: O my lady, you sent me with Muhammad ibn Abdullah on the journey to Syria...

**Khadija** *(eager)*: How did you find him?

**Maysara**: O my lady, I have never seen anyone as trustworthy as him! And trading with him profits double what we profit with others!

**Khadija**: How is that?

**Maysara**: He doesn't cheat, doesn't lie, doesn't betray... And people trust him and buy from him!

**The Narrator**: *Khadija then desired to marry him... Thus the mudaraba was the cause of the blessed marriage from which came the lineage of the Prophet ﷺ!*

</div>

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 The Lesson Learned**

**Honesty is the worker's capital!**

Muhammad ﷺ did not own money, but he owned what is more precious: **truthfulness and honesty**. With them, the mudaraba succeeded and Khadija profited, and Islam profited from this blessed marriage!

</div>

## Contemporary Applications of Mudaraba

### Islamic Investment Funds

<!-- DIAGRAM:mudarabah-fund-structure -->

**Conditions for validity:**
1. Clarity of profit ratios
2. No guarantee of capital
3. Investment in the lawful

### Investment Deposits in Islamic Banks

| Element | Islamic Deposit | Usurious Deposit |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| Relationship | Mudaraba (partnership) | Loan (debt) |
| Capital | Not guaranteed | Guaranteed |
| Profit | Variable percentage | Fixed interest |
| Loss | Borne by depositor | No loss |
| Rule | ✅ Lawful | ❌ Forbidden |

---

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases: Judge for Yourself!

### Case 1: Investment in an Islamic Fund

<div class="scene-box">

**❓ The Question**

I placed 100,000 riyals in an Islamic investment fund. The fund takes:
- 2% annual management fees
- 20% of profits

After a year, the fund lost 10%. Who bears the loss?

</div>

**The Answer:**

✅ **You bear the loss on capital** — because you are the capital owner.

| Element | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Management fees (2%) | Due — because they are fees for work |
| The 20% of profits | Not due — because there is no profit |
| Capital guarantee | If the fund guarantees it = against Sharia ❌ |

---

### Case 2: Financing a Friend's Project

<div class="scene-box">

**❓ The Question**

My friend has an excellent project idea but has no money. I want to finance him with 50,000 riyals on condition we share profits fifty-fifty.

Is this permissible?

</div>

**The Answer:**

✅ **Permissible** — this is a valid Islamic mudaraba. But be careful:

| ✅ Correct | ❌ Wrong |
|-----------|----------|
| Percentage of profit (50%) | Guarantee of capital |
| Document the agreement in writing | Fixed profit (10% annually) |
| Define the type of trade | Fixed amount (5000 for you) |

---

### Case 3: The Investment Deposit

<div class="scene-box">

**❓ The Question**

The Islamic bank offers an "investment deposit" with an expected return of 5% annually.
The conventional bank offers a "deposit" with a guaranteed return of 5%.

What is the difference?

</div>

**The Answer:**

<!-- DIAGRAM:mudarabah-deposit-difference -->

---

### Case 4: Crowdfunding Platforms

<div class="scene-box">

**❓ The Question**

An electronic platform collects investors' funds and finances small projects. It gives investors **12% fixed annual return**.

Is this lawful?

</div>

**The Answer:**

❌ **Forbidden** — the fixed guaranteed return = usury!

**Conditions of Islamic mudaraba:**
- ✅ A percentage of profit, not a fixed amount
- ✅ Possibility of loss
- ✅ Transparency about funded projects
- ❌ "12% guaranteed" = explicit usury

---

### Case 5: Real Estate Investment

<div class="scene-box">

**❓ The Question**

I gave someone a million riyals to buy real estate and rent it. We agreed:
- The rent is for me
- The property belongs to him at the end

Is this valid?

</div>

**The Answer:**

⚠️ **This is not a valid mudaraba** — because:
- Mudaraba concerns trade (buying and selling), not renting
- Agreeing that the property belongs to him = guaranteeing the capital (forbidden!)

**✅ The correct alternative:** 
Partnership in the property:
- Rent is shared according to shares
- At sale, the price is shared according to each one's capital

---

## 💡 Stop and Reflect

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Great Legal Maxim**

> **"Al-ghunm bil-ghurm"** (Profit with risk)

Meaning: whoever wants profit must bear the possibility of loss.

</div>

**Reflect on your investments:**

🔹 Are you looking for a **"guaranteed investment with fixed return"**?
- If you find one, know that it is probably **disguised usury**!

🔹 Real investment involves risk. Are you ready to bear potential loss?

🔹 When you give your money to someone to invest it:
- Do you **document the agreement**?
- Do you **follow the performance** of the investment?
- Do you **know where your money** is invested?

**Remember:** Lawful money may decrease but it is **blessed**, and unlawful money may increase but it is **destroyed**!
