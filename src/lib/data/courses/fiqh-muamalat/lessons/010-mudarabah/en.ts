## Definition of Mudarabah

### Linguistic Meaning
Mudarabah: from "darb" (to travel), meaning to travel for trade. Allah says: ﴿Others travel through the land seeking Allah's bounty﴾ [Al-Muzzammil: 20]

### Technical Meaning
> A partnership contract in profit between the capital owner and the worker, where the owner gives his money to the worker to trade with, and the profit is shared according to their agreement.

It is also called: **Qirad** in the dialect of Hijaz.

## The Legitimacy of Mudarabah

### From the Quran
> Allah تعالى says: ﴿There is no blame upon you for seeking bounty from your Lord﴾ [Al-Baqarah: 198]

### From the Prophetic Sunna
> It is reported that Al-Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib رضي الله عنه, when giving money in mudarabah, would stipulate to his partner not to cross the sea, not to descend into a valley, and not to buy livestock. If he did, he would be liable. His condition reached the Messenger of Allah ﷺ who approved it. [Reported by al-Bayhaqi]

### Consensus
The Companions رضي الله عنهم are unanimous on the permissibility of mudarabah. The orphans of Abdullah ibn Umar and Abdullah ibn Mas'ud would receive their wealth in mudarabah.

### Reason
The need calls for mudarabah: the capital owner may not know how to trade, and the worker may not have money. Mudarabah combines both interests.

## The Pillars of Mudarabah

### First Pillar: The Capital

**Its conditions:**
1. Being in cash: it is not valid in goods according to the majority
2. Being known: in quantity and quality
3. Being specified: not a debt in liability
4. Being delivered to the worker: so he can dispose of it freely

### Second Pillar: The Work

**Its conditions:**
1. Being permissible: mudarabah in the forbidden is prohibited
2. The worker must be independent: free to dispose
3. Being in trade: buying and selling

### Third Pillar: The Profit

**Its conditions:**
1. Being known in percentage: like half or third
2. Being shared: not exclusive to one of them
3. Coming from the profit, not from the capital

**What is prohibited:**
- Fixing a determined amount for one of them
- Guaranteeing the capital on the worker
- Guaranteeing a determined percentage of profit

### Fourth Pillar: The Formula

**Its types:**
- "I give you this money in mudarabah"
- "Take this money, trade with it and the profit is between us"
- Or what indicates that by word or deed

## Types of Mudarabah

### Unrestricted Mudarabah

**Definition:**
The capital owner gives his money to the worker to trade without restriction of type, place, or time.

**Its rules:**
- The worker can trade in all types of commerce
- He can travel with the money
- He can sell for cash or credit according to custom

### Restricted Mudarabah

**Definition:**
The capital owner restricts the worker to a specific type of trade, place, or time.

**Examples:**
- "Trade only in cloth"
- "Do not travel with the money outside the country"
- "Do not sell in installments"

**Rule for violating the condition:**
If the worker violates the condition, he is liable if there is a loss.

## Rules of Mudarabah

### Distribution of Profit

| Situation | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Profit | Divided according to agreement |
| No profit | Nothing for the worker; he lost his effort |
| Loss | On the capital only |

**Important rule:**
> The profit is a protection for the capital.

Meaning the profit compensates the loss first, then the remainder is divided.

### Liability in Mudarabah

**The principle:**
> The worker is a trustee; he is not liable except for abuse or negligence.

**Examples of abuse:**
- Violating the capital owner's condition
- Trading in the forbidden
- Lending the money to others

**Examples of negligence:**
- Leaving the money without protection
- Neglecting the trade until loss occurs

### Expenses of Mudarabah

**From the capital:**
- Normal business expenses
- Storage and transportation costs
- Employee salaries

**From the worker's personal money:**
- His personal expenses in town
- During travel, there is disagreement

## Termination of Mudarabah

### Causes of Termination

1. **Rescission by one of the parties:**
   - Mudarabah is a permissive contract that can be rescinded
   - Liquidation of the partnership is obligatory upon rescission

2. **Death of one of the parties:**
   - Mudarabah ends by the death of either party
   - Heirs can demand liquidation

3. **Insanity of one of the parties:**
   - Because it removes legal capacity

4. **Destruction of capital:**
   - If money is destroyed before use, it ends
   - If destroyed after use, it continues with the remainder

### Liquidation Procedures

1. Sell goods and convert to cash
2. Recover debts due
3. Calculate profit and loss
4. Return capital to its owner
5. Divide profit according to agreement
