<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 Opening Scene: At the Madinah Market**

*The market of Madinah... The sun sends its golden rays upon the sellers and buyers...*

*A man displays his merchandise and swears: By Allah, I bought it for such and such price!*

*The Prophet ﷺ passes by and hears him... He stops and says:*

**The Prophet ﷺ:** "Swearing sells the merchandise, but erases the blessing!"

*(Unanimously agreed upon)*

*The seller falls silent... and the merchants look at each other...*

*Then the Prophet ﷺ says:*

**The Prophet ﷺ:** "The two parties have the option as long as they haven't parted. If they are truthful and transparent, their transaction will be blessed. If they conceal and lie, the blessing of their transaction will be erased."

*(Unanimously agreed upon)*

*Thus the Prophet ﷺ taught his nation that trade is worship... and that honesty is its true capital!*
