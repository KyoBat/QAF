## The Division of Usury

Usury is divided into two main types:
1. **Riba al-Fadl** — The surplus in one of the two exchanged items
2. **Riba an-Nasi'ah** — The delay in receiving one of the two items

> The Prophet ﷺ said: "Gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, salt for salt, like for like, hand to hand. Whoever gives more or asks for more has committed usury." [Reported by Muslim]

---

## First: Surplus Usury (Riba al-Fadl)

### Its Definition
> The increase in one of the two usurious items when the product is sold for its kind.

### Its Example
- Selling gold for gold with a surplus in one
- Selling one kilo of dates for one and a half kilos of dates

### Its Evidence
> The Prophet ﷺ said: "Gold for gold... like for like... Whoever gives more or asks for more has committed usury." [Reported by Muslim]

### Conditions for Its Permissibility
Selling usurious goods of the same type is permitted under two conditions:
1. **Equality** — Equivalence in measure or weight
2. **Immediate exchange** — Receipt in the session

---

## Second: Delay Usury (Riba an-Nasi'ah)

### Its Definition
> The delay in receiving one or both items in the sale of usurious goods.

### Its Divisions

**1. Delay usury in the same type:**
- Selling gold for gold with delayed receipt
- Prohibited by consensus

**2. Delay usury in two types of the same cause:**
- Selling gold for silver on credit
- Selling wheat for barley on credit
- Prohibited due to unity of cause

### Its Evidence
> The Prophet ﷺ said: "If these types differ, sell as you wish, as long as it is hand to hand." [Reported by Muslim]

## Usurious Stratagems

### Their Definition
> Methods to reach usury in an apparently permissible form.

### Their Examples

**1. 'Inah Sale:**
- Selling merchandise on credit then buying it back for cash at a lower price

**2. Organized Tawarruq:**
- Buying merchandise from the bank on credit then selling it back to them for cash

### Their Ruling
