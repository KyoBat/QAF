## The Division of Usury

Usury is divided into two main types:
1. **Riba al-Fadl** — The surplus in one of the two exchanged items
2. **Riba an-Nasi'ah** — The delay in receiving one of the two items

> The Prophet ﷺ said: "Gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, salt for salt, like for like, hand to hand. Whoever gives more or asks for more has committed usury." [Reported by Muslim]

---

## First: Surplus Usury (Riba al-Fadl)

### Its Definition
> The increase in one of the two usurious items when the product is sold for its kind.

### Its Example
- Selling gold for gold with a surplus in one
- Selling one kilo of dates for one and a half kilos of dates

### Its Evidence
> The Prophet ﷺ said: "Gold for gold... like for like... Whoever gives more or asks for more has committed usury." [Reported by Muslim]

### Conditions for Its Permissibility
Selling usurious goods of the same type is permitted under two conditions:
1. **Equality** — Equivalence in measure or weight
2. **Immediate exchange** — Receipt in the session

---

## Second: Delay Usury (Riba an-Nasi'ah)

### Its Definition
> The delay in receiving one or both items in the sale of usurious goods.

### Its Divisions

**1. Delay usury in the same type:**
- Selling gold for gold with delayed receipt
- Prohibited by consensus

**2. Delay usury in two types of the same cause:**
- Selling gold for silver on credit
- Selling wheat for barley on credit
- Prohibited due to unity of cause

### Its Evidence
> The Prophet ﷺ said: "If these types differ, sell as you wish, as long as it is hand to hand." [Reported by Muslim]

## Usurious Stratagems

### Their Definition
> Methods to reach usury in an apparently permissible form.

### Their Examples

**1. 'Inah Sale:**
- Selling merchandise on credit then buying it back for cash at a lower price

**2. Organized Tawarruq:**
- Buying merchandise from the bank on credit then selling it back to them for cash

### Their Ruling

- Usurious stratagems are prohibited
- What counts are the intentions, not the forms

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf: The Scrupulousness of 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz with Wealth

'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz رحمه الله was governor of Medina when a man came complaining that a merchant had lent him money and stipulated an increase.

'Umar summoned the merchant and said: **"What is this I have heard about you?"**

The merchant said: "I only stipulated a gift he would present to me, not an increase in the money!"

'Umar رحمه الله said:

> **"Every loan that brings a benefit is usury, whether you call it a gift, an increase, or a benefit. What counts are the realities, not the names!"**

Then he ordered the gift to be returned and the merchant to repent, and said: **"Whoever hovers around the sanctuary is about to fall into it."**

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### Case 1: Loan Between Friends

**Question:** I lent my friend 10,000 riyals, and upon repayment he gave me 11,000 riyals without me stipulating it. Is this usury?

**Answer:** ✅ **No problem with that** — if it was not stipulated beforehand and not customary between you. The Prophet ﷺ said: "The best of you are the best in repayment" [Agreed upon]. But if the increase is expected or customary, it is usury.

---

### Case 2: Buying a Car on Installments

**Question:** A car dealership sells a car for 80,000 riyals cash and 95,000 riyals on installments. Is this usury?

**Answer:** ✅ **Permitted** — this is installment sale, not a loan. The increase for delay is permitted in sales, not in loans. The difference: in sale you own merchandise, but in a loan you take money to return money.

---

### Case 3: Exchanging Old Gold for New

**Question:** I have old gold weighing 50 grams. I want to exchange it for new gold. The goldsmith gives me 45 grams of new gold for the old. Is this permitted?

**Answer:** ❌ **Not permitted** — this is surplus usury. The obligation: sell the old gold for cash, then buy the new with cash. Surplus is not permitted in gold for gold.

---

### Case 4: Delaying Debt Repayment with Increase

**Question:** I owe 50,000 riyals, and I don't have the amount. The creditor offered to delay repayment 6 months in exchange for 5,000 riyals extra. Is this permitted?

**Answer:** ❌ **Not permitted** — this is delay usury (usury of Jahiliyyah). Increase in exchange for delay in debt is prohibited by consensus. The alternative: ask for respite without increase, or borrow from another source.

---

### Case 5: Bank Interest on Savings

**Question:** I put my money in a bank savings account, and the bank gives me 3% annually. Is this lawful?

**Answer:** ❌ **Prohibited** — this is a usurious loan. You are lending the bank and the bank returns more to you. The alternative: investment deposits in Islamic banks, or lawful investment funds.

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

> **"Usury, even if it increases, its outcome is to little"** — hasan hadith

Reflect on your financial life:

🔹 Do you deal with any entity that gives you "guaranteed returns" on your money?

🔹 When borrowing, do you ensure the contract is free from any conditioned increase?

🔹 How can you arrange your financial affairs to be completely free from usury?

**Remember:** Lawful provision has blessing even if little, and unlawful provision is erased even if abundant.
