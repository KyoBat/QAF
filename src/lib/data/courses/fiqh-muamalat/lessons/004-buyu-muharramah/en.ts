## 📖 Stories from the Salaf: The Scrupulousness of Imam Ahmad

Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal used to refuse to eat from state money out of fear of doubt, despite his poverty.

He used to say: **"Leaving a daniq (small coin) of the prohibited is better than a thousand pilgrimages."**

And when told that some wealth has doubt in it, he said: **"Indeed, a third of people's wealth is prohibited!"** — meaning as a warning against laxity.

**The lesson:** Scrupulousness in transactions is a sign of faith.

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

**Question for reflection**: 

You are a seller, and the entire market cheats: mixing good merchandise with bad.

If you don't do the same, you will lose customers.

**What do you do?**

Remember:
- 🔴 Cheating is prohibited even if everyone does it
- ✅ "Whoever leaves something for Allah, Allah will compensate them with something better"
- 💡 Honesty is blessing, and cheating erases it

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"The two contracting parties have the option as long as they have not separated. If they are truthful and transparent, their sale will be blessed. If they conceal and lie, the blessing of their sale will be erased."**
