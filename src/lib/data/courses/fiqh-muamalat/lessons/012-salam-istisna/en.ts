## 📖 Stories from the Salaf

### The Blessed Salam

Imam Ahmad narrated in his Musnad that **Abdullah ibn Abbas رضي الله عنهما** used to say:

> "The Prophet ﷺ came to Madinah while people were making salam on fruits for one, two, and three years, so the Prophet ﷺ organized this transaction for them and did not prohibit it."

Ibn Abbas said: **"I testify that the guaranteed salam for a specified term, Allah has made it lawful in His Book and permitted it."** Then he recited: ﴿O you who believe, when you contract a debt for a specified term, write it down﴾.

**The lesson:** The Salaf used salam to finance agriculture and industry, demonstrating the flexibility of Shariah in meeting people's legitimate needs while regulating transactions with proper conditions.

> "People have been practicing it from the time of the Prophet ﷺ until today without objection, so this constitutes consensus."

The people of Kufa would order the manufacture of swords, armor, and shoes from craftsmen, paying them in advance or later, and no scholar objected to them.
