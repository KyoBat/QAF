<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 Scene: The Market of Medina — First Year of Hijra**

*The Messenger of Allah ﷺ arrived in Medina and found its inhabitants practicing transactions they had known in the pre-Islamic era. One of them would go to the farmer and give him money in advance in exchange for a harvest he would receive in a year or two...*

**The Ansari:** *(approaching a farmer in the market)*
O Abu So-and-so, I have fifty dinars. I give them to you now, and you give me the dates of your palm tree next year.

**The Farmer:** *(needing money to provide for his family)*
Yes, this is what we are accustomed to doing. But... *(looking around hesitantly)* the Prophet ﷺ has come among us, let us ask him about the ruling on this.

**The Messenger of Allah ﷺ:** *(hearing their question and answering)*
**"Whoever makes a Salam sale, let him do so with a known measure, a known weight, until a known term."**

*Thus the Prophet ﷺ regulated the Salam transaction: he did not prohibit it because people needed it, but he set conditions that preserve everyone's rights.*

## Part One: The Salam Sale

### Definition of Salam

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Juristic Definition**

**Linguistically:** Salam and Salaf have the same meaning, which is **advancement** — meaning to advance payment.

**Technically:**
> **Sale of a described commodity guaranteed by the seller, for a price paid in advance**
>
> That is: paying the price **now**, in exchange for a described commodity to be delivered **later**.

</div>

### Legitimacy of Salam

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Proof from the Quran**

> Allah says: ﴾O you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a specified term, write it down﴿ [Al-Baqarah: 282]

**Ibn Abbas رضي الله عنهما said:**
*"I testify that the guaranteed Salaf until a specified term, Allah has made it lawful in His Book and permitted it."*

</div>

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Proof from the Sunnah**

> Narrated by Ibn Abbas رضي الله عنهما: **The Prophet ﷺ came to Medina while the people were making Salam on fruits for one or two years**, he said:

*A man enters the workshop of a famous carpenter in the Kufa market...*

**The Man:** Master, I would like you to make me a bed of walnut wood, with these dimensions *(showing him a paper)*, and I want it in a month.

**The Carpenter:** The price is twenty dinars. Do you pay now or at delivery?

**The Man:** Half now, and half at delivery.

**The Carpenter:** It's agreed. *(shaking his hand)*

*This is the form of Istisna' that Imam Abu Hanifa رحمه الله authorized, saying: "People have been practicing it from the time of the Prophet ﷺ until today without objection."*

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf

<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 Ibn Abbas Testifies to Salam's Legitimacy**

*Imam Bukhari reports in his Sahih...*

**Abdullah ibn Abbas رضي الله عنهما:** *(standing in a knowledge gathering)*
I testify that **the guaranteed Salaf until a specified term**, Allah has made it lawful in His Book and permitted it.

**One of those present:** What is your proof, O Ibn Abbas?

**Ibn Abbas:** *(reciting with humility)*
﴾O you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a specified term, write it down﴿

Then he said: **The Prophet ﷺ came to Medina while the people were making Salam on fruits for one, two, and three years. The Prophet ﷺ regulated this transaction without prohibiting it, but set conditions saying: "with a known measure, a known weight, until a known term."**

</div>

---

<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 The Wisdom of Imam Abu Hanifa on Istisna'**

*In his circle at the Kufa mosque, Imam Abu Hanifa رحمه الله was asked...*

**The questioner:** O Imam, some say: Istisna' is selling what you don't have, how is it permitted?

**Abu Hanifa:** *(smiling)*
My son, **people have been practicing it from the time of the Prophet ﷺ until today without objection**, so it is a practical consensus.

**The questioner:** How so?

**Abu Hanifa:** Look around you in the Kufa market. People ask craftsmen for:
- The making of swords and armor
- The making of shoes and clothes
- The building of houses and furniture

And they pay them the price in advance or at term, **and no scholar has criticized them**. This is the consensus of the Ummah through practice, and it is stronger than consensus through statement.

**Provided that:**

- ✓ Manufacturer commits to the delivery date
- ✓ Manufacturer bears the risks of production

2. Schedule of construction stages and partial deliveries
3. Installment payments permitted
4. Developer's guarantee until final delivery

### Case Five: Custom Furniture Manufacturing

<div class="case-box">

**🪑 Case: Ordering a bedroom set from a carpenter**

**Question:** I ordered a bedroom set with a custom design from a carpenter. We agreed on the price and delivery in a month. Is it permitted to pay half in advance?

**Answer:** ✅ **Permitted — this is Istisna'**

**Advantage of Istisna' regarding price:** Price in Istisna' is **flexible**:
- ✓ Pay all in advance
- ✓ Pay all at term
- ✓ Pay in installments

*(Unlike Salam which requires advancement)*

</div>

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Question for Reflection**

In our era, crowdfunding platforms that finance projects that don't yet exist have spread.

**Reflect on these questions:**

1️⃣ How can we benefit from the fiqh of the Salaf on Salam and Istisna' to regulate these transactions?

2️⃣ What is the difference between lawful investment and gambling on these platforms?

3️⃣ Does the presence of clear conditions and guarantees transform the transaction from gharar to permissibility?

**The Answer:**
The more precise the specifications, the clearer the guarantees, and the more defined and known the risks, the closer the transaction is to permissibility and further from prohibited gharar.
