**📖 The Scene: The First Lease Contract in History — Madyan Thousands of Years Ago**

*After Moses (peace be upon him) had watered the two women, one of them came to him walking with shyness...*

**One of the Daughters** *(to her father Shu'ayb)*: O father, hire him! The best you can hire is **the strong and trustworthy**!

**Shu'ayb (peace be upon him)** *(to Moses)*: I want to marry you to one of my two daughters...

**Moses** *(waiting)*: ...

**Shu'ayb**: On condition that you **serve me for eight years**, and if you complete ten, it will be from you!

**The Narrator**: *This was the first lease contract mentioned in the Quran — remuneration for work, with a defined duration and known conditions!*

## Legitimacy of Leasing

### From the Quran

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Quranic Proofs**

> ﴿One of them said: "O father, hire him! The best you can hire is the strong and trustworthy."﴾
> — Al-Qasas: 26

> ﴿If they breastfeed for you, give them their wages.﴾
> — At-Talaq: 6

</div>

### From the Prophetic Sunnah

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Proofs from Sunnah**

> 'Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) said: **"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ and Abu Bakr hired a man from Banu ad-Dil as an expert guide."**
> — Narrated by al-Bukhari

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Give the worker his wage before his sweat dries."**
> — Narrated by Ibn Majah

</div>

<div class="scene-box">

**📖 The Story of the Hijra — The First Prophetic Lease Contract**

*Before the Hijra, the Prophet ﷺ and Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) prepare for the secret journey...*

**Abu Bakr** *(whispering)*: O Messenger of Allah, we need a guide who knows the way!

**The Prophet ﷺ**: Hire a man from Banu ad-Dil, an expert guide.

**Abu Bakr**: But he's not Muslim!

**The Prophet ﷺ**: **Trustworthiness is the criterion. We entrust him with our route.**

**The Narrator**: *Thus Abdullah ibn Urayqit, the polytheist, was their guide — because leasing doesn't require the employee to be Muslim!*

</div>

### The Consensus

The Ummah is unanimous on the permissibility of leasing due to people's need — no one can do without the benefit of others.

- The lessor owns the usufruct or has the right to dispose
- The agent leases by proxy

</div>

### Second Pillar: The Formula

| Type | Example | Status |
|------|---------|--------|

2. Their continuity in the session
3. Absence of suspension on an unknown future condition

## Types of Leasing

<!-- DIAGRAM:ijara-types -->

### First Type: Leasing of Specific Assets

<div class="scene-box">

**📖 Examples of Asset Leasing**

**Mohammed**: I want to rent **this apartment** (pointing to it) for a year.

**The Owner**: Agreed, the rent is 12000 riyals annually.

**Mohammed**: I accept.

✅ **This is a lease contract for a specific asset** — the apartment is identified by observation.

</div>

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Delivery | The asset must be handed to the lessee |
| Maintenance | On the owner unless otherwise stipulated |
| Destruction | If the asset is destroyed without abuse, the contract is terminated |

### Second Type: Guaranteed Leasing

**Ahmed**: I want to rent a Toyota Camry 2024 for a week.

**The Company**: Agreed, we have several cars of this type.

## Selling the Leased Asset

<div class="scene-box">

**📖 Common Question**

**Said**: I rented an apartment for a year, and in the middle of the period, the owner sold the building!

**The Question**: Does the lease contract end?

</div>

| Situation | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Sale to the lessee | ✅ Permitted — he becomes owner and rent ceases |
| Sale to a third party | ✅ Permitted — **and the lease contract remains in effect** |

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 The Rule**

> Leasing is a binding contract, it is not terminated by the sale of the leased asset. The new buyer takes possession of the asset after the lease period ends.

</div>

## Termination of the Lease Contract

<!-- DIAGRAM:lease-termination -->

## Lease Ending with Ownership (Hire-Purchase)

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Definition**

**Lease Ending with Ownership**: A lease contract including a promise to transfer ownership of the asset to the lessee at the end of the period.

</div>

### Its Ruling — Contemporary Scholars' Disagreement

<!-- DIAGRAM:lease-to-own -->

### The Unanimously Accepted Lawful Alternative

<div class="scene-box">

**📖 The Correct Method**

**Step ①**: Independent lease contract with monthly payments

**Step ②**: Promise from the owner to sell at the end of the period

**Step ③**: Independent sale contract at the end (symbolic price or gift)

**Result**: Two separate contracts, no problem!

</div>

## 📖 From the Righteous Predecessors: The Employee's Honesty

<div class="scene-box">

**📖 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz and the Treasury Lamp**

*In the caliphate palace, 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz works on Muslim affairs...*

**The Servant**: O Commander of the Faithful, have you finished the official documents?

**'Umar** *(extinguishing the lamp)*: Yes, I'm done.

**The Servant** *(surprised)*: But you want to read a personal letter!

**'Umar** *(lighting another lamp)*: This is my personal lamp.

**The Servant**: What's the difference?

**'Umar**: **That one is the lamp of the Muslims' treasury, it's not permissible for me to use it for my personal affairs. I am their employee!**

</div>

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 The Lesson**

The employee is a trustee of what he is employed for, he does not betray in time, nor in money, nor in resources!

</div>

## 💡 Stop and Reflect

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Question for Reflection**

You are an employee in a company, and the work contract stipulates 8 hours per day. But you spend one hour per day browsing social media.

**Is this lawful according to Sharia?**

</div>

**Reflect with me**:

🔹 You are an **employee**, and the time is not yours — it belongs to the employer

🔹 **"Give the worker his wage before his sweat dries"** — but the worker must also give his due to the work!

🔹 The money you receive for that hour: **is it lawful?**

🔹 If the employer permits it = lawful. Otherwise = **unlawful consumption of property**!
