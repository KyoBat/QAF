- The promise of ownership must be separate from the lease contract
- Transfer must be through a new contract (gift or symbolic sale)
- The lessee must not bear the loss of the asset

**Second opinion: Prohibition**
- For combining two different contracts in one
- For uncertainty in the outcome

### The Shariah-Compliant Alternative

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf: The Worker's Wage

It is reported that Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz رحمه الله would extinguish the treasury's lamp when he finished official work, and light his personal lamp if he wanted to read for himself!

He was asked: Why?

He said: **"This is the Muslims' lamp; it is not permissible for me to use it for my personal affairs."**

**Question for reflection**: 

You are an employee at a company, and the employment contract specifies 8 hours daily. But you spend one hour daily browsing social media.

**Is this permissible in Shariah?**

Remember:
- You are an employee, and the time is not yours
- **"Give the worker his wages before his sweat dries"** = But the worker must also give the right of work
- The money you receive for that hour: is it halal?
