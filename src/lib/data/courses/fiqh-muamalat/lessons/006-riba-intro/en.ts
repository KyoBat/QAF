## 📖 Stories from the Salaf: 'Umar ibn al-Khattab and Usury

'Umar ibn al-Khattab رضي الله عنه was extremely cautious about usury, to the point that he said:

> "Among the last verses revealed of the Quran was the verse of usury, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ passed away without explaining it to us. So leave usury and doubt."

He used to say: **"We left nine-tenths of the lawful out of fear of usury."**

**The lesson:** If 'Umar رضي الله عنه, with his understanding and knowledge, took such precaution, what about us?

## The Doubt of the People of Ignorance and Its Response

### The Doubt
> They said: {Trade is like usury} [Al-Baqarah: 275]

They claimed that usury is like trade in increase and profit.

### The Quranic Response
> {And Allah has permitted trade and has forbidden usury} [Al-Baqarah: 275]

**The difference between trade and usury:**

| Trade | Usury |
|-------|-------|
| Profit in exchange for goods or service | Increase in exchange for money only |
| Risk exists | Guaranteed without risk |
| Benefits both parties | Harms one of the parties |
| Encourages production | Paralyzes production |

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases: Is This Usury?

### Case 1: Housing Loan from a Conventional Bank
**Ahmad** wants to buy a house for 500,000 riyals. The bank lends him the amount and asks for repayment of 650,000 riyals over 20 years.

**Question**: Is this usury?

**Ruling**: ✅ **Yes, this is explicit usury** — a conditioned increase in exchange for delay = delay usury.

**The lawful alternative**: Financing through murabahah or lease-to-own through Islamic banks.

---

### Case 2: Credit Card
**Sarah** uses a credit card. If she pays before the end of the month, she pays nothing extra. But if she is late, she is charged 2% monthly interest.

**Question**: Is using the card permissible?

**Ruling**: 
- ✅ **Full payment before due date**: permitted
- ❌ **Being late and paying interest**: prohibited usury

---

### Case 3: "Buy Now, Pay Later" Apps
An app allows you to buy a phone for 3000 riyals in 4 installments. If you are late, delay fees are added.

**Question**: What is the ruling?

**Ruling**:
- ✅ **Installments without increase**: permitted
- ❌ **Late fees**: prohibited usury

## 📖 From History: The Usury Crisis in Europe

In the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church strictly prohibited usury, following the Torah text. But with the development of trade, laxity began until usury was fully permitted.

**The result**: The successive financial crises — the 1929 crisis, the 2008 crisis — are all the result of the usurious system.

**The lesson**: What Allah has prohibited is not restriction, but protection for humanity.

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

**Question for reflection**: 

If you had a sum of money and wanted to invest it, and your options were:
1. A bank deposit at 5% annual interest (guaranteed)
2. Partnership in a business venture (risky but lawful)

Which would you choose? And why?

**Remember**: Allah does not prohibit something except that He gives you a better alternative. {And whoever fears Allah, He will make for him a way out. And will provide for him from where he does not expect.}
