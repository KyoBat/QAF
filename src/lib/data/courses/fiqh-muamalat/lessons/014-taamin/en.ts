**🎬 Scene: A Knowledge Circle — A Young Man's Question About Insurance**

*In a study circle after Asr prayer, a young man asks the sheikh...*

**The Young Man:** O Sheikh, the company I work for requires insurance, the government requires car insurance, and the bank requires insurance for loans... How do I deal with all this?!

**The Sheikh:** *(smiling)*
This is one of the most important questions of our time. Insurance has spread like wildfire, but the Sharia has a clear position on it.

**The Young Man:** What is that position?

**The Sheikh:** Listen, my son... **Commercial insurance is forbidden (haram), and cooperative insurance (Takaful) is permissible (halal)**. And there are fundamental differences between the two.

*Let us learn together these differences, and how to distinguish between the permissible and the forbidden in the world of insurance.*

## Part One: Understanding Insurance

### Definition of Insurance

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Juristic Definition**

**Linguistically:**
At-Ta'min (insurance): comes from **al-amn** (security), meaning protection from fear and harm.

**Technically:**
> **A contract whereby the insurer (insurance company) commits to pay the insured a sum of money when the insured risk occurs, in exchange for premiums paid by the insured.**
>
> That is: I pay you money now ← so you pay me later if a certain risk occurs.

## Part Two: Ruling on Commercial Insurance

<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 Scene: In an Insurance Agent's Office**

*A man asks the insurance agent about the contract...*

**The Client:** I want to understand... I pay you 500 riyals per month, what do I get in return?

**The Agent:** If you have an accident, we compensate you up to 100,000 riyals.

**The Client:** And if I don't have any accident all year?

**The Agent:** *(with a commercial smile)*
The premiums you paid stay with us... That's insurance!

**The Client:** *(thinking)*
So I might pay 6,000 riyals in a year and get nothing?!

**The Agent:** Yes, and you might pay 6,000 and get 100,000!

*Here is where gambling and uncertainty appear... One of us wins and the other loses for sure!*

</div>

### Legal Ruling

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Decisions of Fiqh Academies**

> **Commercial insurance in its prevalent form is forbidden by the Sharia**

This decision was issued by:
- **International Islamic Fiqh Academy** (Jeddah)
- **Council of Senior Scholars** (Saudi Arabia)
- **Islamic Fiqh Academy** (Muslim World League)

<!-- DIAGRAM:taamin-riba -->

#### Third Reason: Gambling (Maysir)

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 The Prohibition of Gambling**

> Allah says: ﴾O you who believe! Wine, gambling, idols, and divination arrows are an abomination, the work of Satan. So avoid them!﴿
>
> [Al-Ma'ida: 90]

</div>

<!-- DIAGRAM:taamin-gambling-comparison -->

#### Fourth Reason: Consuming Others' Wealth Unjustly

> Allah says: ﴾Do not consume your wealth among yourselves unjustly﴿
>
> [Al-Baqara: 188]

**Explanation:**

## Part Three: Cooperative Insurance (Takaful)

<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 Scene: A Contemporary Fiqh Lesson**

**The Sheikh:** If commercial insurance is forbidden, what is the alternative?

**The Student:** We don't know, O Sheikh!

**The Sheikh:** The alternative exists in our Islamic heritage for 14 centuries!

**The Student:** *(amazed)* How?!

**The Sheikh:** The **'Aqila** system in Islam. If a Muslim accidentally kills another Muslim, who pays the blood money?

**The Student:** His tribe and relatives.

**The Sheikh:** **Exactly!** This is solidarity and mutual assistance. Each one pays a portion to cover his brother's harm. No one expected profit!

*This is the origin of Takaful insurance.*

</div>

### Definition of Cooperative Insurance

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Definition**

> **An agreement among a group of people to cooperate in bearing the damages that may befall any of them, through donating money collected in a special fund.**
>
> The fundamental difference: **Premiums are donations, not commercial exchange**

</div>

### Difference Between Commercial and Cooperative Insurance

### Legitimacy of Cooperative Insurance

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 From the Quran**

> Allah says: ﴾Cooperate in righteousness and piety, and do not cooperate in sin and aggression﴿

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 From the Prophetic Sunnah**

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"The example of the believers in their mutual love, mercy, and compassion is like one body: if one part suffers, the whole body responds with sleeplessness and fever."**
>
> [Agreed upon]

> And he ﷺ said: **"The believer to the believer is like a building whose parts support each other."**
>
> [Agreed upon]

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf

<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 The 'Aqila System — Origin of Takaful**

*In the prophetic era, a man from the Ansar accidentally killed someone...*

**The Judge:** What is the ruling on this killing?

**The Prophet ﷺ:** Accidental killing, and the blood money is upon **the 'Aqila**.

**The Narrator:** The blood money was collected from the killer's tribe, each paying according to his degree of kinship.

**The Lesson:**
This is Islamic solidarity:
- No one profits from his brother's misfortune
- Everyone bears the burden together
- No uncertainty, no usury, no gambling

</div>

<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 Umar ibn al-Khattab and the Registry of Grants**

*Under the caliphate of Umar رضي الله عنه, he established a unique social system...*

**Umar رضي الله عنه:**
I will give every Muslim his right from the treasury, even the shepherd in the mountains of Sanaa has his share.

**The Narrator:**
He would give people from the treasury when in need, and would support widows and orphans.

**The Lesson:**
Social solidarity is an authentic Islamic principle, and Takaful insurance is its extension.

</div>

<div class="scene-box">

**🎬 The Solidarity of the Muhajirin and Ansar**

*When the Muslims emigrated to Medina...*

**The Prophet ﷺ:** I have established brotherhood between the Muhajirin and the Ansar.

**The Ansar:** *(to the Muhajirin)*
We share our wealth with you, and we host you in our homes!

**The Narrator:**
The Ansari would offer his Muhajir brother half of his wealth.

**The Lesson:**
This is the greatest solidarity: no one expected profit, it was pure giving.

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### Case One: Mandatory Auto Insurance

<div class="quote-box">

**🚗 Case: Mandatory auto insurance**

**Question:** Fatima lives in a country that requires auto insurance. Can she subscribe?

**Answer:** ✅ Permissible by necessity — what is essential to fulfill an obligation becomes obligatory itself.

**Conditions:**
- Limit to the minimum mandatory coverage
- Look for Takaful companies if available
- Do not expand to additional coverages

**Rule:** Necessity permits the prohibited, and necessities are measured proportionately.

</div>

> **⚠️ Note:** Some scholars **prohibit commercial insurance absolutely**, even if mandatory, and consider that legal compulsion does not make the contract permissible, but merely lifts the sin from the one who is compelled. The fatwa above represents the opinion of those who apply the legal maxim of necessity.

---

### Case Two: Employer Health Insurance

<div class="quote-box">

**🏥 Case: Health insurance provided by employer**

**Question:** Ahmad is employed at a company that provides health insurance to all employees. Can he benefit from it?

**Answer:** ✅ Permissible — this is part of salary and benefits.

**Detail:**
- The employee did not choose or sign the contract
- This is part of his employment rights
- The sin falls on the company if it's commercial

**Ideal:** Request Takaful insurance if possible.

</div>

---

### Case Three: Life Insurance

<div class="quote-box">

**👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Case: Life insurance for children's future**

### Case Five: Cargo Insurance for Imports

<div class="quote-box">

</div>

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

<div class="quote-box">

**📜 Question for Reflection**

Why has commercial insurance spread in Muslim countries despite the scholars' prohibition?

**Reflect on the reasons:**

1️⃣ Absence of Islamic alternative for decades

2️⃣ Pressing need for insurance in modern life

3️⃣ Weakness of religious awareness among many people

4️⃣ Economic and legal pressures (mandatory insurance)

**What can you do?**
- Support Takaful companies by dealing with them
- Spread awareness about the Islamic alternative
- Ask before subscribing: is this Takaful or commercial?
- Call for establishing solidarity funds in your community
