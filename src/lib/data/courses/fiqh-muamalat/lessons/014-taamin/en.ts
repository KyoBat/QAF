**Decisions of Fiqh Academies:**
- International Islamic Fiqh Academy
- Council of Senior Scholars of Saudi Arabia
- Islamic Fiqh Academy of the Muslim World League

---

### Reasons for Prohibition of Commercial Insurance

**First Reason: Excessive Uncertainty (Gharar)**

**Definition of Gharar:**
> Ignorance regarding the object sold, the price, or the outcome.

**The aspect of uncertainty in insurance:**
- The insured doesn't know how much they will pay in premiums
- Doesn't know if they will receive compensation or not
- The insurer doesn't know how much they will pay in compensations

**The evidence:**
> The Messenger of Allah ﷺ prohibited sale involving uncertainty. [Reported by Muslim]

---

**Second Reason: Usury (Riba)**

**Types of usury in insurance:**

| Type | Aspect |
|------|--------|
| Surplus usury | If paying few premiums and receiving large compensation |
| Delay usury | Deferring receipt in financial exchanges |

**Explanation:**
- The premium is money
- The compensation is money
- Exchanging between them without equality or receipt = usury

---

**Third Reason: Gambling (Maysir)**

**The resemblance to gambling:**
- The insured pays premiums
- They may win (large compensation) or lose (no compensation)
- The result depends on a random event

**The evidence:**
> Allah تعالى says: ﴿O you who believe, wine, gambling, stone altars, and divining arrows are an abomination of Satan's handiwork. Avoid it﴾ [Al-Ma'idah: 90]

---

**Fourth Reason: Consuming People's Wealth Unjustly**

**Detail:**
- The company takes the premiums
- It may pay nothing if the risk doesn't occur
- The premiums go without countervalue

**The evidence:**
> Allah تعالى says: ﴿Do not consume your wealth among yourselves unjustly﴾ [Al-Baqarah: 188]

---

## Cooperative Insurance (Takaful)

### Definition
> An agreement among a group of people to cooperate in bearing the damages that may affect one of them, through donating sums of money collected in a special fund.

### Difference Between Commercial and Cooperative Insurance

| Commercial Insurance | Cooperative Insurance |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Exchange contract | Donation contract |
| Profit-oriented goal | Cooperation-oriented goal |
| Premiums belong to company | Premiums belong to participants |
| Surplus for company | Surplus for participants |
| Exchange relationship | Solidarity relationship |

---

### Legitimacy of Cooperative Insurance

**From the Quran:**
> Allah تعالى says: ﴿Help one another in righteousness and piety﴾ [Al-Ma'idah: 2]

**From the Prophetic Sunna:**
> The Prophet ﷺ said: "The example of believers in their mutual love, mercy, and compassion is like one body; if one limb suffers, the whole body responds with sleeplessness and fever." [Agreed upon]

> And he ﷺ said: "The believer to the believer is like a building whose parts reinforce each other." [Agreed upon]

**From the Practice of the Companions:**
The 'Aqilah system in Islam: the tribe bears the blood money for unintentional killing.
