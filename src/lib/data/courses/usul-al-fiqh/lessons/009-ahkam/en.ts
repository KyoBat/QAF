# Legal Rulings (Al-Ahkam At-Taklifiyyah)

## Introduction

Legal rulings (ahkam taklifiyyah) are the Shariah prescriptions that address legally responsible persons (mukallaf) regarding their actions. They represent the fruit and objective of the science of Islamic legal theory (usul al-fiqh).

## Definition of Hukm Taklifi

**Linguistically:** Al-hukm means judgment and obligation.

**Technically:** It is the address of Allah concerning the acts of legally responsible persons in terms of demand or choice.

## The Five Categories of Legal Rulings

### First Category: Wajib (Obligatory)

**Definition:** What the Lawgiver has commanded to be done in a decisive manner.

**Ruling:** One who performs it in compliance is rewarded, and one who abandons it is punished.

**Examples:**
- The five daily prayers
- Fasting in Ramadan
- Zakat
- Hajj for those with ability
- Kindness to parents

**Subdivisions of Wajib:**

1. **According to time:**
   - Wajib mutlaq (absolute): not time-bound (like expiations)
   - Wajib muqayyad (restricted): time-bound (like the five prayers)

2. **According to the person:**
   - Wajib 'ayni (individual): obligatory on each individual (like prayer)
   - Wajib kifa'i (collective): if some perform it, others are exempted (like funeral prayer)

3. **According to quantity:**
   - Wajib muhaddad (defined): with specified measure (like number of rak'at)
   - Wajib ghayr muhaddad (undefined): without specified measure (like spending on relatives)

### Second Category: Mandub (Recommended)

**Definition:** What the Lawgiver has requested to be done without strict obligation.

**Ruling:** One who performs it is rewarded, and one who leaves it is not punished.

**Other names:** Sunnah, mustahabb, nafila, tatawwu'.

**Examples:**
- Regular voluntary prayers (rawatib)
- Fasting on Mondays and Thursdays
- Duha prayer
- Using the siwak
- Night prayer (qiyam al-layl)

**Levels of Mandub:**
1. **Sunnah mu'akkadah (emphasized):** regularly practiced by the Prophet ﷺ (like witr)
2. **Sunnah ghayr mu'akkadah:** practiced occasionally
3. **Mustahabb:** encouraged by the Law without regularity

### Third Category: Haram (Prohibited)

**Definition:** What the Lawgiver has commanded to abandon in a decisive manner.

**Ruling:** One who abandons it in compliance is rewarded, and one who commits it is punished.

**Examples:**
- Associating partners with Allah (shirk)
- Unlawful killing
- Adultery and fornication
- Usury (riba)
- Alcohol consumption
- Disobedience to parents
- Consuming the wealth of orphans

**Types of Prohibition:**
1. **Haram li-dhatihi:** prohibited in itself (like adultery)
2. **Haram li-ghayrihi:** prohibited for an external reason (like selling during the Friday call)

### Fourth Category: Makruh (Disliked)

**Definition:** What the Lawgiver has requested to abandon without strict obligation.

**Ruling:** One who abandons it is rewarded, and one who commits it is not punished.

**Examples:**
- Asking too many questions without need
- Eating and drinking while standing (according to some scholars)
- Sleeping after 'Asr prayer
- Turning around in prayer without need

**Types of Makruh:**
1. **Makruh tahriman:** close to prohibited (according to Hanafis)
2. **Makruh tanzihan:** mildly disliked

### Fifth Category: Mubah (Permissible)

**Definition:** That for which the Lawgiver has given choice between doing and leaving.

**Ruling:** Neither reward nor punishment for doing or leaving it in itself.

**Examples:**
- Eating and drinking lawful things
- Choosing permissible clothing
- Traveling between countries
- Choosing a lawful profession

**Important Note:**
The mubah may become recommended, obligatory, disliked, or prohibited based on intentions and means.

## Conditions of Legal Responsibility

A person is only considered legally responsible (mukallaf) if they meet the following conditions:

1. **Reason ('aql):** no responsibility for the insane
2. **Puberty (bulugh):** no responsibility for children
3. **Understanding the address:** no responsibility for what is not understood
4. **Ability to comply:** no responsibility for the impossible

## Hukm Wad'i (Declaratory Ruling)

Alongside the rulings of responsibility, there are declaratory rulings that concern establishing something as a cause, condition, impediment, validity, or invalidity.

**Examples:**
- **Cause (sabab):** entering the prayer time causes its obligation
- **Condition (shart):** purification is a condition for prayer's validity
- **Impediment (mani'):** menstruation prevents prayer
- **Validity (sihha):** fulfillment of pillars and conditions
- **Invalidity (fasad):** lacking a pillar or condition

## Difference Between Fard and Wajib

**According to the majority:** Fard and wajib have the same meaning.

**According to Hanafis:** There is a difference:
- **Fard:** established by definitive evidence (like prayer)
- **Wajib:** established by probable evidence (like witr prayer)

## Importance of Knowing the Rulings

Knowledge of legal rulings is necessary for every Muslim in order to:
- Know their obligations and fulfill them
- Know the prohibitions and avoid them
- Distinguish between recommended and obligatory
- Avoid ambiguities and practice piety

## Conclusion

The five legal rulings are: obligatory (wajib), recommended (mandub), prohibited (haram), disliked (makruh), and permissible (mubah). They encompass all acts of legally responsible persons, and knowing them is the foundation of practicing Islamic law.
