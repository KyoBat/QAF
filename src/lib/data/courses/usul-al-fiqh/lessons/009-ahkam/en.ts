# Legal Rulings (Al-Ahkam At-Taklifiyyah)

## Introduction

Legal rulings (ahkam taklifiyyah) are the Shariah prescriptions that address legally responsible persons (mukallaf) regarding their actions. They represent the fruit and objective of the science of Islamic legal theory (usul al-fiqh).

## Definition of Hukm Taklifi

**Linguistically:** Al-hukm means judgment and obligation.

**Technically:** It is the address of Allah concerning the acts of legally responsible persons in terms of demand or choice.

## The Five Categories of Legal Rulings

### First Category: Wajib (Obligatory)

**Definition:** What the Lawgiver has commanded to be done in a decisive manner.

**Ruling:** One who performs it in compliance is rewarded, and one who abandons it is punished.

**Examples:**
- The five daily prayers
- Fasting in Ramadan
- Zakat
- Hajj for those with ability
- Kindness to parents

**Subdivisions of Wajib:**

1. **According to time:**
   - Wajib mutlaq (absolute): not time-bound (like expiations)
   - Wajib muqayyad (restricted): time-bound (like the five prayers)

2. **According to the person:**
   - Wajib 'ayni (individual): obligatory on each individual (like prayer)
   - Wajib kifa'i (collective): if some perform it, others are exempted (like funeral prayer)

3. **According to quantity:**
   - Wajib muhaddad (defined): with specified measure (like number of rak'at)
   - Wajib ghayr muhaddad (undefined): without specified measure (like spending on relatives)

### Second Category: Mandub (Recommended)

**Definition:** What the Lawgiver has requested to be done without strict obligation.

**Ruling:** One who performs it is rewarded, and one who leaves it is not punished.

**Other names:** Sunnah, mustahabb, nafila, tatawwu'.

**Examples:**
- Regular voluntary prayers (rawatib)
- Fasting on Mondays and Thursdays
- Duha prayer
- Using the siwak
- Night prayer (qiyam al-layl)

**Levels of Mandub:**
1. **Sunnah mu'akkadah (emphasized):** regularly practiced by the Prophet ﷺ (like witr)
2. **Sunnah ghayr mu'akkadah:** practiced occasionally
3. **Mustahabb:** encouraged by the Law without regularity

### Third Category: Haram (Prohibited)

**Definition:** What the Lawgiver has commanded to abandon in a decisive manner.

**Ruling:** One who abandons it in compliance is rewarded, and one who commits it is punished.

**Examples:**
- Associating partners with Allah (shirk)
- Unlawful killing
- Adultery and fornication
- Usury (riba)
- Alcohol consumption
- Disobedience to parents
- Consuming the wealth of orphans

**Types of Prohibition:**
1. **Haram li-dhatihi:** prohibited in itself (like adultery)
2. **Haram li-ghayrihi:** prohibited for an external reason (like selling during the Friday call)

### Fourth Category: Makruh (Disliked)

**Definition:** What the Lawgiver has requested to abandon without strict obligation.

**Ruling:** One who abandons it is rewarded, and one who commits it is not punished.

**Examples:**
- Asking too many questions without need
- Eating and drinking while standing (according to some scholars)
- Sleeping after 'Asr prayer
- Turning around in prayer without need

**Types of Makruh:**
1. **Makruh tahriman:** close to prohibited (according to Hanafis)
2. **Makruh tanzihan:** mildly disliked

### Fifth Category: Mubah (Permissible)

**Definition:** That for which the Lawgiver has given choice between doing and leaving.

**Ruling:** Neither reward nor punishment for doing or leaving it in itself.

**Examples:**
- Eating and drinking lawful things
- Choosing permissible clothing
- Traveling between countries
- Choosing a lawful profession

**Important Note:**
The mubah may become recommended, obligatory, disliked, or prohibited based on intentions and means.

## Conditions of Legal Responsibility

A person is only considered legally responsible (mukallaf) if they meet the following conditions:

1. **Reason ('aql):** no responsibility for the insane
2. **Puberty (bulugh):** no responsibility for children
3. **Understanding the address:** no responsibility for what is not understood
4. **Ability to comply:** no responsibility for the impossible

## Hukm Wad'i (Declaratory Ruling)

Alongside the rulings of responsibility, there are declaratory rulings that concern establishing something as a cause, condition, impediment, validity, or invalidity.

**Examples:**
- **Cause (sabab):** entering the prayer time causes its obligation
- **Condition (shart):** purification is a condition for prayer's validity
- **Impediment (mani'):** menstruation prevents prayer
- **Validity (sihha):** fulfillment of pillars and conditions
- **Invalidity (fasad):** lacking a pillar or condition

## Difference Between Fard and Wajib

**According to the majority:** Fard and wajib have the same meaning.

**According to Hanafis:** There is a difference:
- **Fard:** established by definitive evidence (like prayer)
- **Wajib:** established by probable evidence (like witr prayer)

## Importance of Knowing the Rulings

Knowledge of legal rulings is necessary for every Muslim in order to:
- Know their obligations and fulfill them
- Know the prohibitions and avoid them
- Distinguish between recommended and obligatory
- Avoid ambiguities and practice piety

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf

### The Scrupulousness of Abdullah ibn Umar in Rulings

Abdullah ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) was among the most scrupulous and careful of the Companions in matters of rulings. He used to say:

> **"I care not whether I abandon an obligation or commit a prohibition—both are grave before Allah."**

When asked about an issue, he would say: **"I don't know,"** then would research and ask until he was certain.

From his scrupulousness, he would avoid doubtful matters—he would not eat food with the slightest doubt, nor wear clothing about which he had suspicion.

Once asked about a delicate matter, he said: **"Ask someone else, for I fear making lawful what is unlawful or making unlawful what is lawful."**

**The Lesson**: The Salaf magnified the five rulings and were careful about them, fearing they might fall into the forbidden or abandon the obligatory. This scrupulousness is the fruit of understanding legal rulings and the great responsibility before Allah.

### Al-Hasan al-Basri on Distinguishing Between Obligatory and Recommended

A man came to Al-Hasan al-Basri (may Allah have mercy on him) and said: "O Abu Sa'id, I increase in voluntary fasting and night prayer, but I sometimes fall short in praying Fajr in congregation."

Al-Hasan said: **"You tire yourself in voluntary acts while neglecting the obligations! Truly Allah will ask you about what He made obligatory upon you, not about what you volunteered."**

Then he said: **"Whoever performs the obligations and leaves the voluntary acts is saved, God willing. But whoever brings the voluntary acts and neglects the obligations is ruined."**

**The Lesson**: Distinguishing between the obligatory and the recommended is essential for prioritizing. The obligatory takes precedence over the recommended, and it is not permissible to be occupied with voluntary acts at the expense of obligations.

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### Case One: Congregational Prayer and Work

**Question**: An employee works during Zuhr prayer time and cannot perform it in the mosque. What is the ruling on praying alone at work?

**Answer**: Congregational prayer is obligatory or strongly emphasized according to most scholars. But praying on time is a definitive obligation. If congregation is not possible, one prays alone, and it is not permissible to delay the prayer beyond its time. Distinguishing between the absolute obligation (prayer) and the conditional obligation (congregation) is essential.

---

### Case Two: Zakat or Sadaqah?

**Question**: Someone gives large amounts in charity to the poor throughout the year but does not calculate their zakat precisely. Does their charity suffice for zakat?

**Answer**: Voluntary charity does not suffice for obligatory zakat. Zakat is a pillar of Islam with specific conditions and amounts. Charity is voluntary. Whoever increases in voluntary acts while leaving the obligation has misplaced priorities.

---

### Case Three: The Permissible That Becomes Forbidden

**Question**: Eating is permissible—in what situations does eating become forbidden?

**Answer**: The permissible may transform into forbidden by intention or effect:
- Eating with the intention of strengthening oneself for sin: forbidden
- Eating to the point of harmful excess: forbidden
- Eating during Ramadan days while fasting: forbidden
- Eating from usurped property: forbidden

The ruling changes with the change of intention and circumstances.

---

### Case Four: Emphasized Sunnahs

**Question**: What is the practical difference between leaving the emphasized sunnah and the non-emphasized sunnah?

**Answer**: The emphasized sunnah (like witr and the two rak'ahs before Fajr), if left habitually without excuse, its leaver is blameworthy, and some scholars held him sinful. As for the non-emphasized sunnah, there is no blame in leaving it. But both are recommended—the doer is rewarded and the leaver is not punished.

---

### Case Five: Ambiguities Between Lawful and Unlawful

**Question**: Food about which I don't know whether it was slaughtered according to Islamic law or not—what is the ruling on eating it?

**Answer**: If in a Muslim country, the default is permissibility because the common practice is proper slaughter. If in a non-Muslim country, caution is to leave it. Being cautious about ambiguities is recommended, as the Prophet ﷺ said: **"Whoever avoids doubtful matters has protected his religion and honor."**

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

> Review your last day: How many obligatory acts did you perform? How many forbidden acts did you avoid? How many recommended acts did you do or leave? Do you give obligations their priority over recommended acts in your life? Can you easily distinguish between the five rulings in your daily actions?

---

## Conclusion

The five legal rulings are: obligatory (wajib), recommended (mandub), prohibited (haram), disliked (makruh), and permissible (mubah). They encompass all acts of legally responsible persons, and knowing them is the foundation of practicing Islamic law.
