# Istihsan and Istishab

## Part One: Istihsan (Juristic Preference)

### Definition of Istihsan

**Istihsan** (الاستحسان) is departing from the ruling of one evidence to the ruling of another stronger evidence, or departing from one qiyas to a stronger qiyas, or excepting a case from a general principle due to a specific evidence.

#### Linguistic Definition

- **Istihsan** linguistically means: considering something good and finding it pleasing

#### Technical Definition

> Istihsan is: abandoning qiyas and adopting what is more suitable for people.
> 
> It is also said: it is departing from an obvious qiyas to a subtle qiyas, or from a general ruling to an exceptional ruling due to an evidence requiring that.

### Types of Istihsan

#### 1. Istihsan by Text

Departing from qiyas due to a text from the Quran or Sunnah.

**Example**: Salam sale (sale of a described item for immediate payment)
- Qiyas: prohibits it because it's selling what doesn't exist
- Istihsan: its permission by the text: "Whoever makes salam, let him do so in a known measure..."

#### 2. Istihsan by Consensus

Departing from qiyas due to scholarly consensus on the contrary.

**Example**: Istisna' contract (manufacturing order)
- Qiyas: prohibits it because the sold item doesn't exist
- Istihsan: its permission by practical consensus

#### 3. Istihsan by Subtle Qiyas

Abandoning the obvious qiyas to adopt a subtler and stronger qiyas.

**Example**: Leftover water from birds of prey
- Obvious Qiyas: impurity by analogy to wild beasts
- Subtle Qiyas: purity because they drink with their beaks which are pure

#### 4. Istihsan by Interest

Abandoning qiyas to achieve a recognized interest.

**Example**: Liability of the shared craftsman
- Qiyas: not liable because he's a trustee
- Istihsan: liable to protect people's property

#### 5. Istihsan by Custom

Abandoning qiyas to act according to what people customarily do.

**Example**: Entering public baths
- Qiyas: prohibits it due to ignorance of water quantity and duration
- Istihsan: permission by custom

#### 6. Istihsan by Necessity

Abandoning qiyas for necessity or urgent need.

**Example**: Purity of wells
- Qiyas: impurity by contact with impurity
- Istihsan: purity by drawing water due to necessity

### Schools' Positions on Istihsan

| School | Position |
|--------|----------|
| Hanafis | Extensively adopt it |
| Malikis | Adopt it and sometimes call it "Istislah" |
| Hanbalis | Adopt it in certain cases |
| Shafi'is | Verbally reject it but apply its meaning |

### Imam Shafi'i's Statement on Istihsan

Imam Shafi'i said: **"Whoever does istihsan has legislated"**

The meaning: rejecting istihsan by mere desire and whim, not istihsan regulated by evidences.

## Part Two: Istishab (Presumption of Continuity)

### Definition of Istishab

**Istishab** (الاستصحاب) is ruling that something continues in the present based on its existence in the past, in the absence of what would change it.

#### Linguistic Definition

- **Istishab** linguistically means: seeking companionship and its continuation

#### Technical Definition

> Istishab is: maintaining what was in its previous state in the absence of change.

### Types of Istishab

#### 1. Presumption of Original Innocence

The origin is freedom from obligations and rights until the contrary is proven.

**Example**: 
- Zakat is not obligatory until one possesses the nisab
- The accused is innocent until proven guilty

#### 2. Presumption of the Characteristic Establishing the Ruling

If a characteristic is established entailing a ruling, the ruling continues as long as the characteristic persists.

**Example**: 
- Ownership of property continues until its cessation is proven
- Marriage continues until divorce is proven

#### 3. Presumption of the Legal Ruling

If a legal ruling is established, it is maintained until an abrogator comes.

**Example**: 
- Permission to eat camel meat continues (for those who hold this view)

#### 4. Presumption of Consensus in the Place of Disagreement

Maintaining the consensual ruling in the disputed matter.

**Example**: 
- Consensus on validity of prayer of one who made tayammum is maintained if he sees water during prayer

### Rules Derived from Istishab

| Rule | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| The origin is maintaining what was | Things continue in their state until the contrary is proven |
| Certainty is not removed by doubt | What is established by certainty is not lifted by doubt |
| The origin is innocence of obligation | No obligation without evidence |
| The origin in things is permissibility | Permissibility is the origin until evidence of prohibition |
| The origin in intimate relations is prohibition | Marital relations are originally prohibited until the contract is proven |

### Practical Examples of Istishab

#### In Worship

| Issue | Ruling | Reasoning |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| One who doubts his state of impurity | Pure | Presumption of established purity |
| One who doubts number of rak'ahs | Builds on the lesser | Presumption of non-performance of the doubtful rak'ah |

#### In Transactions

| Issue | Ruling | Reasoning |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| One who claims a debt against another | The word is with the denier | Presumption of defendant's innocence |
| Absent person whose state is unknown | Treated as living | Presumption of his established life |

### Authority of Istishab

#### According to the Majority

Istishab is evidence in negation and affirmation, and it is applied in the absence of changing evidence.

#### Proofs of its Authority

1. **From the Quran**: ﴿He it is Who created for you all that is on earth﴾ proof that the origin is permissibility
2. **From the Sunnah**: "Leave it until it urinates" regarding land whose impurity is doubted
3. **From Reason**: Certainty of the state continuing in the absence of change

### Difference Between Istihsan and Istishab

| Istihsan | Istishab |
|----------|----------|
| Deviation from one evidence to a stronger | Maintaining the previous state |
| Requires exceptional evidence | Does not require new evidence |
| Its authority is disputed | Its authority is accepted by the majority |

## Conclusion

Istihsan and Istishab are two evidences of Islamic jurisprudence that enable the jurist to reach the appropriate legal ruling, while observing the guidelines of Sharia and achieving its objectives of facilitation and removal of hardship.
