## 📖 Introduction

### 📜 Scene: Abu Hanifa and the Thief

> **Kufa, 2nd century AH...**
>
> A man came to **Imam Abu Hanifa** — may Allah have mercy on him — and said:
>
> *"O Imam, a poor man stole a loaf of bread. Should his hand be cut off?"*
>
> According to the general rule: *Whoever steals the nisab amount, his hand is cut off.*
>
> But Abu Hanifa said:
>
> **"I use istihsan here! His hand is not cut off due to his dire need and the smallness of the matter."**
>
> A student asked: *"How can you leave the rule?"*
>
> Abu Hanifa replied:
>
> **"I don't leave the rule! I apply a stronger evidence — the Prophet ﷺ said: 'Ward off hudud punishments with doubts.'"**

> 🎯 **This is istihsan — leaving the apparent rule for a stronger evidence!**

---

### 📜 Scene: Ash-Shafi'i's Criticism

> **Imam Ash-Shafi'i** — may Allah have mercy on him — criticized istihsan:
>
> **"Whoever uses istihsan legislates."**
>
> But the Hanafis explained:
>
> **"We don't legislate! We leave one evidence for a stronger one. It's not based on desire."**

> 💡 **The disagreement is about terminology, not reality!**

## ⚖️ Authority of Istihsan

### Those Who Accept It

| School | Position |
|--------|----------|

| ⚫ Zahiris | Reject it completely |

### Reality of the Disagreement

> **Ibn Qudama** — may Allah have mercy on him — said:

## 🔗 Difference Between Istihsan and Qiyas

| Qiyas | Istihsan |
|-------|----------|
| Following the apparent rule | Leaving the apparent for stronger |
| Based on clear analogy | Based on subtle evidence |
| The default | The exception |

---

## 📜 Story: The Well and Purity

### The Issue

> A mouse fell into a well. The Hanafis said:
>
> **By qiyas**: The entire water is impure because an impurity fell in it.
>
> **By istihsan**: The water is not impure because it's difficult to avoid such occurrences in wells.

### The Reasoning

| Qiyas | Istihsan |
|-------|----------|
| Mixing with impurity | General affliction principle |
| Requires draining | Draining some suffices |

> 💡 **Istihsan considers reality and hardship!**
