# Qiyas (Analogical Reasoning)

## Definition of Qiyas

**Qiyas** (القياس) is the linking of a subsidiary case to an original case in a legal ruling due to their sharing a common effective cause.

### Linguistic Definition

- **Qiyas** linguistically means: measurement and equalization
- One says: he measured (qasa) the cloth with a cubit, meaning he compared it to it

### Technical Definition

> Qiyas is: applying a known case to another known case to establish or negate a ruling for both, through a common element between them, whether it be a ruling or a characteristic.

## The Pillars of Qiyas

Qiyas is built upon four essential pillars:

### 1. The Original Case (Al-Asl - المقيس عليه)

This is the case where the ruling is established by text or consensus.

**Example**: Wine in Allah's saying: ﴿Wine, gambling... are an abomination of Satan's handiwork. Avoid it﴾

### 2. The Subsidiary Case (Al-Far' - المقيس)

This is the case for which the ruling is sought to be established through analogy.

**Example**: Intoxicating nabidh (fermented drink)

### 3. The Ruling of the Original (Hukm al-Asl)

This is the legal ruling established in the original case that is intended to be applied to the subsidiary.

**Example**: The prohibition of wine

### 4. The Effective Cause ('Illa - العلة)

This is the apparent and precise characteristic upon which the ruling is based.

**Example**: Intoxication (which is the common cause between wine and nabidh)

## Types of Qiyas

### According to Strength

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Qiyas al-Awla (a fortiori) | The subsidiary deserves the ruling more | Prohibition of striking parents by analogy to prohibition of saying "uff" |
| Qiyas al-Musawi (equal) | The subsidiary equals the original | Prohibition of nabidh by analogy to wine |
| Qiyas al-Adna (lesser) | The subsidiary is less appropriate | Linking apples to wheat in prohibition of riba |

### According to the Cause

1. **Qiyas al-'Illa**: The cause is textually stated or derived
2. **Qiyas al-Dalala**: Linking through indication of the cause, not the cause itself
3. **Qiyas al-Shabah**: The subsidiary oscillates between two originals, linked to the more similar

## Conditions for Valid Qiyas

### Conditions for the Original

1. Its ruling must be established by Quran, Sunnah, or Consensus
2. The original must not itself be a subsidiary of another
3. The ruling must be rationally understandable (not purely devotional)

### Conditions for the Subsidiary

1. The cause present in the original must exist in it
2. There must be no text establishing its ruling
3. Its ruling must not precede the original's ruling

### Conditions for the Ruling

1. It must be a practical legal ruling
2. It must not be specific to the original (like the Prophet's ﷺ special rulings)
3. The cause must be rationally comprehensible

### Conditions for the Cause

1. It must be an apparent and precise characteristic
2. It must be transitive (not limited to the original)
3. It must not invalidate the text
4. It must be appropriate to the ruling

## Methods of Establishing the Cause

### 1. Text (al-Nass)

When the Lawgiver explicitly states the cause.

**Example**: The Prophet's ﷺ saying: "I only forbade you because of the visitors" (cause for prohibiting storage of sacrificial meat)

### 2. Indication (al-Ima')

When the characteristic is associated with the ruling in a way that suggests causation.

**Example**: The Prophet ﷺ said to one asking about giving dates as charity: "Do fresh dates decrease when dried?" He said: Yes. He said: "Then no"

### 3. Consensus (al-Ijma')

When scholars agree on the cause of a ruling.

### 4. Suitability (Takhrij al-Manat)

Extracting a non-textual cause by examining the suitability between the characteristic and the ruling.

### 5. Examination and Division (al-Sabr wal-Taqsim)

Enumerating characteristics suitable for causation, then eliminating those that do not fit.

### 6. Refinement of the Criterion (Tanqih al-Manat)

Removing characteristics that have no effect on the ruling.

## Authority of Qiyas

### Arguments of Those Who Accept It

1. **From the Quran**: ﴿So take admonition, O you with insight﴾ - admonition is analogy
2. **From the Sunnah**: The Prophet's ﷺ analogies, like his saying to the Khath'ami woman: "Do you see if your father had a debt..."
3. **From Consensus**: The Companions' agreement on using analogy
4. **From Reason**: The Sharia came to bring benefits and repel harms

### The Zahiri Position

The Zahiris denied the authority of Qiyas, saying one must adhere to the apparent meanings of texts.

## Qiyas and Text

### When Qiyas Contradicts Text

The text takes absolute precedence over Qiyas, because Qiyas is a branch and text is the source.

**Principle**: No Qiyas in the presence of text.

## Practical Examples

### First Example: Prohibition of Drugs

| Pillar | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Original | Wine |
| Subsidiary | Drugs (hashish, heroin...) |
| Ruling of Original | Prohibition |
| Cause | Intoxication and clouding of reason |

### Second Example: Sale of a Defective Car

| Pillar | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Original | Sale of musarrah (sheep with retained milk) |
| Subsidiary | Defective car with hidden defect |
| Ruling of Original | Buyer's right of option |
| Cause | Deception and fraud |

## Qiyas According to the Four Schools

- **Hanafis**: Expand Qiyas and sometimes prefer it over solitary hadith
- **Malikis**: Use it while considering public interest
- **Shafi'is**: Regulate Qiyas with precise conditions
- **Hanbalis**: Use it in the absence of text

## 📖 Stories from the Companions: The Qiyas of Mu'adh ibn Jabal

When the Prophet ﷺ sent Mu'adh ibn Jabal to Yemen as a judge, he asked him:

**"By what will you judge?"**

He said: By the Book of Allah.

He said: **"And if you do not find it?"**

He said: By the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.

He said: **"And if you do not find it?"**

He said: **I will exercise my own reasoning (ijtihad) and spare no effort.**

The Prophet ﷺ struck his chest and said: **"Praise be to Allah who has guided the messenger of the Messenger of Allah to what pleases the Messenger of Allah."**

**The Lesson**: Ijtihad and qiyas are legislated when there is no text.

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

**Practical Exercise**: 

Apply qiyas yourself: What is the ruling on **video games that contain gambling** (like loot boxes)?

Try to identify:
1. The original case
2. The common cause
3. The ruling

**Answer**: By analogy to maysir (gambling) — **prohibited** because it involves paying money to obtain something unknown.

## Conclusion

Qiyas is a foundation of Islamic legislation that enables the mujtahid to link new issues to textually established ones. It is proof of the flexibility of Islamic Sharia and its suitability for every time and place.
