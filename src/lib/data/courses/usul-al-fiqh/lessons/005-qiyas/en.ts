## 📖 Introduction

### 📜 Scene: Omar and the Date Wine

> **Medina, during the caliphate of Omar...**
>
> A man came to **Omar ibn al-Khattab** — may Allah be pleased with him — and asked:
>
> *"O Commander of the Faithful, we have a drink made from dates called nabidh. Is it permissible?"*
>
> Omar gathered the Companions and said:
>
> **"Wine was forbidden because it intoxicates and prevents from prayer. Does this nabidh intoxicate?"**
>
> They answered: *"Yes, if one drinks a lot of it."*
>
> Omar ruled:
>
> **"Whatever intoxicates in large amounts is forbidden even in small amounts. It has the same cause as wine!"**

> 🎯 **This is qiyas — extending a ruling from an original case to a new case because they share the same cause!**

---

### 📜 Scene: Ali and Reasoning

> **Ali ibn Abi Talib** — may Allah be pleased with him — was asked:
>
> *"Did the Messenger of Allah ﷺ specify you with something special?"*
>
> Ali replied:
>
> *"No, except what is in this sheet... and a man's understanding of his religion."*

> 💡 **Qiyas is part of understanding the religion!**
