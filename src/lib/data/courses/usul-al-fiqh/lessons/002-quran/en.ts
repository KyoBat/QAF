# The Quran as a Source of Legislation

## Definition of the Quran

**The Quran** is the speech of Allah the Most High, revealed to His Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, in clear Arabic language, whose recitation is an act of worship, transmitted to us through mass transmission (tawatur), written in the Mushaf from the first Surah Al-Fatiha to the last Surah An-Nas.

### Characteristics of the Quran

1. **Speech of Allah**: not the speech of humans or angels
2. **Revealed**: descended from Allah through Jibril (Gabriel)
3. **In Arabic language**: revealed in eloquent classical Arabic
4. **Recitation as worship**: its reading is a rewarded act of worship
5. **Transmitted by tawatur**: transmitted through a continuous, certain chain

## Position of the Quran in Legislation

### The Primary Source of Rulings

Allah the Most High says:

> **"And We have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things and as guidance and mercy and good tidings for the Muslims"** [An-Nahl: 89]

### Authority of the Quran

- **Definitively established** (qat'i al-thubut): because transmitted by tawatur
- **Obligatory to follow**: Muslims must comply with it
- **Abrogated only by Quran**: what is abrogated from it is by another verse

## Types of Quranic Indications

### Regarding Establishment

| Type | Ruling |
|------|--------|
| Definitive establishment | All of the Quran is definitively established |

### Regarding Meaning

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Definitive meaning (qat'i al-dalala) | Admits only one meaning | Inheritance verses |
| Probable meaning (zanni al-dalala) | Admits multiple meanings | The term "qur'" in waiting period |

## Rulings in the Quran

### Doctrinal Rulings (Beliefs)

- Monotheism and belief in Allah
- Belief in angels, books, and messengers
- Belief in the Last Day and divine decree

### Practical Rulings (Jurisprudential)

#### Verses on Worship

- Prayer: **"Establish prayer and give Zakat"** [Al-Baqara: 43]
- Fasting: **"Fasting has been prescribed for you"** [Al-Baqara: 183]
- Pilgrimage: **"And to Allah upon the people is a pilgrimage to the House"** [Al-Imran: 97]

#### Verses on Transactions

- Sale and commerce
- Usury and its prohibition
- Debts and documentation

#### Verses on Personal Status

- Marriage and divorce
- Maintenance and custody
- Inheritance

### Moral Rulings

- Truthfulness and honesty
- Kindness to parents
- Good character

## Methods of the Quran in Explaining Rulings

### Command and Prohibition

- **Command**: indicates obligation unless diverted by evidence
- **Prohibition**: indicates prohibition unless diverted by evidence

### General and Specific

- General verses encompassing all individuals
- Specific verses for particular categories

### Absolute and Restricted

- Absolute terms not restricted
- Restricted terms by description or condition

## Relationship Between Quran and Sunnah

### The Sunnah Explains the Quran

Allah the Most High says:

> **"And We revealed to you the Reminder that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them"** [An-Nahl: 44]

### Types of Explanation

1. **Detailing the concise**: like detailing how to pray
2. **Specifying the general**: like specifying inheritance verses
3. **Restricting the absolute**: like restricting the hand in theft

## The Clear and the Ambiguous

### The Clear (Muhkam)

- Evident meaning not requiring interpretation
- Such as explicit ruling verses

### The Ambiguous (Mutashabih)

- Requires interpretation and exegesis
- Understood in light of the clear

Allah the Most High says:

> **"It is He who has sent down to you the Book; in it are verses that are precise - they are the foundation of the Book - and others unspecific"** [Al-Imran: 7]

## Conclusion

The Quran is the primary source of Islamic legislation, definitively established, containing passages of definitive meaning and others of probable meaning, and the Prophetic Sunnah explains and details it.
