## 📖 Introduction

### 📜 Scene: The Four Schools in History

> **Baghdad, 4th century AH...**
>
> A student asked his teacher:
>
> *"Why do we have different schools? Isn't the truth one?"*
>
> The teacher smiled and said:
>
> **"These schools are like rivers flowing from one sea — the sea of the Prophet's ﷺ Sunnah. Each Imam understood as much as Allah granted him. All of them are on guidance."**
>
> The student asked: *"So which do I follow?"*
>
> The teacher replied:
>
> **"Follow any of them with sincerity, and you will find guidance. Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity."**

> 🎯 **Taqlid of qualified imams is the path of the Ummah!**

---

### 📜 Scene: The Wisdom of Diversity

> **Imam Ibn Taymiyyah** — may Allah have mercy on him — was asked:
>
> *"Is scholarly disagreement a mercy or a tribulation?"*
>
> He replied:
>
> **"Disagreement in branches is a mercy, and agreement on fundamentals is the religion. The Companions differed in matters of fiqh, yet loved each other and prayed behind one another."**

> 💡 **Diversity in fiqh is richness — not a problem!**
