# Consensus (Ijma)

## Definition of Consensus

**Ijma** linguistically: determination and agreement.

**Ijma** technically: the agreement of the mujtahids of the Islamic community in a given era after the death of the Prophet ﷺ on a legal ruling.

### Explanation of the Definition

- **Agreement**: approval of all is necessary
- **Of the community's mujtahids**: the opinion of laypeople or followers does not count
- **In a given era**: agreement of all mujtahids across eras is not required
- **After the death of the Prophet ﷺ**: because during his life, revelation was the reference
- **On a legal ruling**: in religious matters, not purely worldly affairs

## Authority of Consensus

### Evidence from the Quran

Allah the Most High says:

> **"And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination"** [An-Nisa: 115]

**Point of evidence**: Allah threatens whoever follows a path other than that of the believers, which proves that following their path is obligatory, and their path is what they agreed upon.

### Evidence from the Sunnah

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **"My community will not agree upon error"** [Reported by Ibn Majah]

> **"Allah's hand is with the group"** [Reported by at-Tirmidhi]

### Reason

The Islamic community is protected from agreeing on error, and this is from Allah's mercy upon it.

## Pillars of Consensus

### First Pillar: The Participants in Consensus

| Condition | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Islam | The opinion of a non-Muslim does not count |
| Maturity and sanity | The opinion of a child or insane person does not count |
| Ijtihad | Must be among the people of derivation |

### Second Pillar: The Subject of Consensus

- That it be a legal ruling
- That it be from matters of ijtihad

### Third Pillar: The Agreement

- Agreement of all mujtahids
- According to some scholars, disagreement of one or two does not count

## Types of Consensus

### By Method of Formation

| Type | Definition | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| Explicit Consensus | Each mujtahid clearly states their opinion | Definitive evidence |
| Tacit Consensus | Some express themselves and others remain silent | Controversial |

### By Era

| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Consensus of the Companions | Strongest type due to their proximity to the Prophet ﷺ |
| Consensus of the Followers | Evidence in absence of Companion contradiction |
| Consensus of Scholars | In any era |

## Conditions of Consensus

### Unanimously Accepted Conditions

1. **That it be preceded by evidence**: consensus reveals evidence, does not establish rulings
2. **Extinction of the era**: according to some scholars, death of mujtahids is required
3. **Non-contradiction of definitive text**: no consensus contradicting Quran or mass-transmitted Sunnah

### Controversial Conditions

- Requirement of era extinction
- Requirement of a specific number

## Basis of Consensus

### What Can Serve as a Basis

- **The Quran**: an explicit or apparent verse
- **The Prophetic Sunnah**: an authentic or good hadith
- **Qiyas**: for those who consider it valid

### Can Consensus Be Based on Ijtihad?

- The majority require a legal basis
- Some allowed consensus based on qiyas and ijtihad

## Examples of Consensus

### Doctrinal Consensuses

- Belief that Allah is One without partner
- Belief in the prophethood of Muhammad ﷺ

### Jurisprudential Consensuses

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Obligation of the five prayers | Consensus |
| Obligation of fasting Ramadan | Consensus |
| Prohibition of fornication | Consensus |
| Prohibition of alcohol | Consensus |
| Obligation of Zakat on gold and silver | Consensus |

## Consensus and Disagreement

### If Consensus Has Occurred

- It is forbidden to contradict it
- It becomes definitive evidence
- No consensus can form after it on its opposite

### If Disagreement Has Occurred

- Consensus cannot form after it
- Prior disagreement prevents later consensus

## Possibility of Consensus

### In the Early Era

It was possible due to the small number of mujtahids and their proximity.

### In Later Eras

Scholars differed on its possibility due to:
- Dispersion of mujtahids across countries
- Difficulty of knowing all mujtahids
- Difficulty of communication (in the past)

## Conclusion

Consensus is the third evidence for legal rulings after the Quran and Sunnah, it is a definitive proof according to the majority of scholars, it is forbidden to contradict it, and its strongest type is the consensus of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them).
