# Legal Maxims (Al-Qawa'id Al-Fiqhiyyah)

## Introduction

Legal maxims are among the most important sciences that help the jurist master and understand fiqh. They gather numerous branches under unifying principles, thereby facilitating memorization, understanding, and derivation.

## Definition of Legal Maxims

**Linguistically:** Al-qa'ida means the base or foundation. Its plural is qawa'id.

**Technically:** A universal ruling that applies to its particulars to know their status.

Or: General legal principles in concise formulations containing general legislative rules concerning cases that fall under their subject.

## Difference Between Legal Maxim and Usul Rule

| Legal Maxim | Usul Rule |
|-------------|-----------|
| Concerns subsidiary rulings | Concerns methods of deduction |
| Subject: acts of responsible persons | Subject: legal proofs |
| Derived from branches | Derived from language and Law |
| Ex: Harm must be eliminated | Ex: Command implies obligation |

## Importance of Legal Maxims

1. **Mastering fiqh:** and gathering its elements
2. **Facilitating memorization:** instead of memorizing thousands of issues
3. **Aiding ijtihad:** in new situations
4. **Understanding objectives of the Law:** through universal rules
5. **Unifying methodology:** in derivation and fatwa

## The Five Major Legal Maxims

Scholars agree on five major maxims to which most of fiqh is traced:

### First Maxim: Matters Are According to Their Intentions

**Formulation:** "Matters are according to their intentions" or "Actions are only by intentions"

**Meaning:** Legal rulings depend on intention and purpose.

**Evidence:** The hadith "Actions are only by intentions and everyone gets only what they intended"

**Applications:**
- One who prays intending a voluntary prayer, it does not count as obligatory
- Lost property: if he intends to keep it as trust, and if he intends to appropriate it, he is liable
- One who takes another's property thinking it is his own must return it when he knows
- Metaphorical expressions require intention

**Derived maxims:**
- Intention is a condition for validity of worship
- No reward without intention
- What counts in contracts are intentions, not formulations

### Second Maxim: Certainty Is Not Removed by Doubt

**Formulation:** "Certainty is not removed by doubt"

**Meaning:** What is established by certainty is not annulled except by equivalent certainty.

**Evidence:** The hadith "If one of you doubts in his prayer and does not know whether he prayed three or four rak'at, let him discard the doubt and build on what he is certain of"

**Applications:**
- One who is certain of his purity and doubts its invalidation is pure
- One who doubts the number of divorces builds on the minimum
- The principle is innocence until proven otherwise
- The principle is permanence of the prior state

**Derived maxims:**
- The principle is permanence of the prior state
- The principle for things is permissibility
- The principle is absence of liability
- What is established by certainty is not removed by doubt

### Third Maxim: Hardship Brings Ease

**Formulation:** "Hardship brings ease"

**Meaning:** When matters become constricted, they expand; the Law came to remove difficulty.

**Evidence:** Allah says: ﴿Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship﴾

**Applications:**
- Permission to break fasting in Ramadan for the sick and traveler
- Permission to shorten and combine prayers during travel
- Tayammum when water is absent or one is unable to use it
- Permission to eat carrion for the desperate
- Praying seated for one who cannot stand

**Derived maxims:**
- Necessities render prohibitions permissible
- What is permitted by necessity is limited to its measure
- Need takes the status of necessity
- When matters become constricted, they expand

### Fourth Maxim: Harm Must Be Eliminated

**Formulation:** "Harm must be eliminated" or "No harm and no reciprocal harm"

**Meaning:** Obligation to eliminate harm and prevent harming others.

**Evidence:** The hadith "No harm and no reciprocal harm"

**Applications:**
- Prohibition of fraud in sales
- Interdiction from managing for the foolish to protect their property
- Obligation of guarantee for the transgressor
- Prohibition of causing what harms the neighbor
- Rescission of contracts for defect

**Derived maxims:**
- Harm is not eliminated by equivalent harm
- Greater harm is eliminated by lesser harm
- Private harm is tolerated to repel public harm
- Repelling harms is prioritized over attracting benefits

### Fifth Maxim: Custom Is Authoritative

**Formulation:** "Custom is authoritative"

**Meaning:** Usage and custom are considered in legal rulings.

**Evidence:** Allah says: ﴿Take what is acceptable and enjoin what is good﴾

**Conditions for considering custom:**
1. That it be constant or predominant
2. That it exist at the time of discourse
3. That it not contradict a legal text
4. That it not contradict an explicit condition

**Applications:**
- Determining the wife's maintenance according to custom
- What is considered reception in sales
- Determining defects of goods
- What is considered defect in marriage

**Derived maxims:**
- What is known by custom is like what is stipulated
- Designation by custom equals designation by text
- Literal meaning is abandoned by indication of custom

## Other Important Legal Maxims

### Maxims on purification and worship:
- Water is purifying and nothing makes it impure except what dominates its color, taste, or smell
- That without which the obligatory cannot be fulfilled is obligatory

### Maxims on transactions:
- The principle in contracts is permissibility
- Profit goes with risk
- Revenue goes with guarantee
- Proof is upon the claimant and oath upon the denier

### Maxims on crimes:
- A Muslim is not killed for a disbeliever (according to the majority)
- The crime does not exceed the criminal
- Whoever dies because of his own act, his blood is void

## Application of Maxims to Contemporary Issues

Legal maxims are an important tool in contemporary ijtihad:
- Hardship brings ease: applies to travel dispensations by airplane
- Harm must be eliminated: in environmental and consumer protection laws
- Custom is authoritative: in electronic commerce contracts

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf

**The Maxim "Certainty Is Not Removed by Doubt" — How the Companions Applied It**

A man came to the Prophet ﷺ complaining that he imagined something during prayer (meaning he doubted: did he invalidate his ablution or not?).

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: **"Let him not leave until he hears a sound or perceives a smell."**

This hadith established a great maxim: certainty is not abandoned for doubt.

Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) used to say: "If you doubt, build on certainty."

It is reported that a man came to Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) and said: "I feel something in my stomach, and I don't know if I broke my ablution or not."

Ali said: "The devil comes to one of you in prayer and blows in his seat. Let him not leave until he hears a sound or perceives a smell."

**The Lesson**: Legal maxims are derived from the texts of revelation and from the understanding of the Companions. They facilitate practical life for the Muslim.

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### Case One: The Maxim "Matters Are According to Their Intentions" in E-Commerce

**Question:** A person bought a product online intending to return it after using it. Is he sinful?

**Answer:** Yes, he is sinful, because his intention at the time of purchase was corrupt. The maxim "Matters are according to their intentions" indicates that one who intends deception and fraud has a void act even if the outward appearance is permissible. This is from the prohibited deception.

---

### Case Two: The Maxim "Hardship Brings Ease" at Work

**Question:** An employee works 12 hours and cannot perform Zuhr and Asr prayers on time. May he combine them?

**Answer:** Combining prayers merely due to work is not permissible according to the majority of scholars, as regular work is not considered an excuse for combining. However, he should:
- Organize his time to pray even briefly
- Negotiate with his employer for a prayer break
- If this is completely impossible and occurs rarely, some scholars have allowed combining for need

As for working in a non-Muslim country with no alternative, some jurists show flexibility in the matter.

### Case Three: The Maxim "Harm Must Be Eliminated" in Neighborhood Disputes

**Question:** My neighbor raises chickens in his apartment, and the smell bothers us. What is the ruling?

**Answer:** By the maxim "No harm and no reciprocal harm," you have the right to demand that he remove the source of harm. If he refuses:
1. A complaint is filed with the relevant authorities
2. The judge may compel him to remove the harm
3. The neighbor is legally and religiously obligated not to harm his neighbors

Ibn Qudama said: "He may not do in his property what harms his neighbor."

---

### Case Four: The Maxim "Custom Is Authoritative" in Dowries

**Question:** A man married without specifying the dowry, then they disagreed. How is this resolved?

**Answer:** Reference is made to the prevailing custom in their country and social class, which is called "the equivalent dowry" (mahr al-mithl). The following are considered:
- The dowries of her sisters and relatives
- The prevailing custom in that environment
- The social and educational level of the wife

This is a practical application of the maxim "Custom is authoritative."

---

### Case Five: The Maxim "Certainty Is Not Removed by Doubt" in Purification

**Question:** I performed ablution, then an hour later I doubted: did I break my ablution or not?

**Answer:** You are in a state of purity because you are certain of your ablution and doubtful about invalidation, and certainty is not removed by doubt. Build on the foundation, which is the permanence of purity.

But if the reverse is true (certain of invalidation, doubtful of ablution), then you are in a state of impurity and must perform ablution.

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

> **Question for Reflection:**
>
> Imam Al-Qarafi said: "Rigidly adhering to transmitted texts forever is misguidance in religion and ignorance of the objectives of Muslim scholars and the righteous predecessors."
>
> How do you understand this statement in light of legal maxims? How can knowledge of the major legal maxims help you deal with daily situations for which you find no explicit text?
