> **Imam Al-Qarafi** — may Allah have mercy on him — said:
>
> **"Whoever masters the legal maxims is dispensed from memorizing most specific rulings."**

---

## 📖 Introduction

### 📜 Scene: Omar and the Justice of Principles

> **Medina, during the caliphate of Omar...**
>
> A man came disputing with another over a damaged item.
>
> The first said: *"He damaged my property, he must compensate!"*
>
> The second said: *"I didn't intend to damage it! It was an accident!"*
>
> **Omar** — may Allah be pleased with him — ruled:
>
> **"The guarantor compensates even without intention. Unintentional harm is like intentional in liability."**
>
> Then he added:
>
> **"This is a principle: 'There should be no harm and no reciprocating harm.'"**

> 🎯 **This is one of the five major legal maxims!**

### 📜 Scene: The Scholar and the Traveler

> A traveler came to **Imam Al-'Izz ibn Abd al-Salam** — may Allah have mercy on him — and said:
>
> *"I'm confused! Every land I enter has different rulings! Are there general principles to guide me?"*
>
> Al-'Izz said:
>
> **"Yes! Fiqh in its entirety returns to a few major maxims. Master them, and you'll understand the differences."**

> 💡 **Legal maxims are the keys to understanding fiqh!**
