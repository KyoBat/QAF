# The Prophetic Sunnah

## Definition of Sunnah

**Sunnah** linguistically: the way and conduct, whether good or bad.

**Sunnah** technically according to usulists: what emanated from the Prophet ﷺ in terms of speech, action, or approval.

### Categories of Sunnah

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Verbal (Qawliyya) | What the Prophet ﷺ said | "Actions are but by intentions" |
| Practical (Fi'liyya) | What the Prophet ﷺ did | The manner of praying and performing Hajj |
| Approving (Taqririyya) | What the Prophet ﷺ approved by silence or approval | His approval of eating lizard |

## Authority of the Prophetic Sunnah

### Evidence from the Quran

Allah the Most High says:

> **"And whatever the Messenger has given you - take; and what he has forbidden you - refrain from"** [Al-Hashr: 7]

> **"Say: If you love Allah, then follow me, Allah will love you"** [Al-Imran: 31]

> **"Nor does he speak from desire. It is not but a revelation revealed"** [An-Najm: 3-4]

### Evidence from the Sunnah

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **"Indeed, I have been given the Quran and something like it along with it"** [Reported by Abu Dawud]

### Consensus

The Ummah is unanimous on the obligation to follow the authentic Prophetic Sunnah.

## Position of the Sunnah in Relation to the Quran

### The Sunnah with the Quran

1. **Confirming the Quran**: like confirming the obligation of prayer and Zakat
2. **Explaining the Quran**: like explaining how to pray and perform Hajj
3. **Independent with new rulings**: like prohibiting marrying a woman and her aunt together

### Types of Explanation

| Type | Explanation | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Detailing the concise | Clarifying what is summarized in the Quran | Detailing the rules of prayer |
| Specifying the general | Limiting some individuals from the general | "No bequest for an heir" |
| Restricting the absolute | Adding a restriction to the absolute | Cutting the right hand in theft |

## Categories of Sunnah by Transmission

### Mutawatir (Mass-transmitted)

- **Definition**: what is reported by such a large number that their agreement on falsehood is impossible
- **Status**: provides certain knowledge
- **Example**: hadiths about the Basin (Hawd) and Intercession

### Ahad (Singular)

- **Definition**: what does not reach the level of tawatur
- **Status**: provides preponderant probability if its chain is authentic
- **Subdivisions**: well-known (mashhur), rare ('aziz), singular (gharib)

## Conditions for Accepting Hadith

### Conditions of Authenticity

1. **Continuity of chain**: no break in the chain of narrators
2. **Integrity of narrators**: they must be Muslim, adult, and sane
3. **Precision of narrators**: their memorization and mastery of the hadith
4. **Absence of anomaly**: the trustworthy not contradicting one more trustworthy
5. **Absence of hidden defect**: free from hidden invalidating defects

### Levels of Hadith

| Level | Definition | Status |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Sahih (Authentic) | Fulfills all conditions | Evidence to be followed |
| Hasan (Good) | Slightly diminished precision | Evidence to be followed |
| Da'if (Weak) | One condition unfulfilled | Not usable for rulings |
| Mawdu' (Fabricated) | Invented about the Prophet ﷺ | Forbidden to narrate except to warn |

## Legislative and Non-Legislative Sunnah

### What is Legislative

- Worship and legal rulings
- Ethics and commanded manners

### What is Not Legislative

- Purely worldly matters (like palm pollination)
- Instinctive acts (like the manner of eating and drinking)
- Prophetic specificities

## Relationship Between Sunnah and Ijtihad

### Did the Prophet ﷺ Perform Ijtihad?

- The majority hold that he could perform ijtihad in matters without revelation
- If he erred in ijtihad, revelation would descend to correct him

## Importance of Sunnah in Islamic Fiqh

- **The Quran cannot be understood without it**: as it is its practical explanation
- **Source of many rulings**: like detailed Zakat rules
- **Preserved by Allah**: through the efforts of scholars and their documentation

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf: Imran ibn Husayn and Adherence to the Sunnah

Imran ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) was sitting with his companions when a man said: "Tell us only from the Quran, leave us from hadith!"

Imran became angry and said: **"Do you see if you and your companions were left with only the Quran, would you find in it that Dhuhr is four rak'ahs, Asr is four rak'ahs, and Maghrib is three? Would you find in the Quran that tawaf is seven circuits and sa'i is seven circuits?"**

Then he said: **"O people! Take from us, for by Allah, if you do not, you will certainly go astray."**

**The Lesson**: The Sunnah is essential for understanding the religion, and whoever claims independence from it has been ignorant of the reality of legislation.

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases: Dealing with the Prophetic Sunnah

### Case 1: "This is a Weak Hadith"

**Context**: A person refuses to act on a hadith because he heard it is weak.

**Question**: Is everything said to be weak not to be acted upon?

**Answer**: ⚠️ One must verify the source of the weakening. The hadith may be authentic according to other hadith scholars. A weak hadith may be strengthened by supporting narrations. The reference is the specialists.

---

### Case 2: Using a Fabricated Hadith

**Context**: A hadith spreads on the internet: "Seek knowledge even in China."

**Question**: Is it valid to use it as evidence?

**Answer**: ❌ This hadith is very weak or fabricated according to many hadith scholars. It is not permissible to attribute it to the Prophet ﷺ, and seeking knowledge is established by many authentic evidences.

---

### Case 3: Legislative and Customary Sunnah

**Context**: A person insists on always wearing white because the Prophet ﷺ used to wear it.

**Question**: Is the Prophet's ﷺ wearing of white an obligatory legislation?

**Answer**: ✅ Wearing white is a recommended sunnah but not obligatory. The Prophet's ﷺ natural and habitual actions are not binding legislation, unlike his devotional acts.

---

### Case 4: Denying the Authority of the Sunnah

**Context**: Some claim the Sunnah is not authoritative and the Quran is sufficient.

**Question**: What is the response to this doubt?

**Answer**: ❌ This contradicts the Quran itself which commands following the Messenger ﷺ. It contradicts the consensus of the Ummah across centuries. Whoever denies the authority of the Sunnah cannot pray, give zakat, or perform hajj.

---

### Case 5: Distinguishing Between Understanding and Text

**Context**: Two scholars differ in understanding one hadith.

**Question**: Does this mean the Sunnah is unclear?

**Answer**: ✅ Disagreement in understanding does not diminish the authority of the text. Just as the Quran has clear and ambiguous verses, so does the Sunnah. Disagreement is a mercy when built on correct scholarly methodology.

---

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

**Question for Reflection**: How do you verify the authenticity of hadiths you use in your daily life? Do you distinguish between legislative and customary Sunnah?

**Remember**:
- The Sunnah is revelation from Allah like the Quran
- The Quran cannot dispense with the Sunnah
- Verifying hadith authenticity is a religious trust
- Understanding the Sunnah requires specialists

## Conclusion

The Prophetic Sunnah is the second source of legislation after the Quran, it is a binding evidence, explains and details the Quran and provides independent rulings, and the Muslim must follow it and act upon it.
