>
> Imran replied:
>
> **"You and your companions pray, where do you find in the Quran that Dhuhr is four rak'ahs, with silent recitation? Where do you find the tawaf around the Ka'bah seven times? Where do you find stoning the jamarat?"**
>
> The man was silent.
>
> Imran said:
>
> **"This is the Sunnah! You cannot dispense with it!"**
