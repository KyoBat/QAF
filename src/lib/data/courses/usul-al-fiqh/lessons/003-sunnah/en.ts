# The Prophetic Sunnah

## Definition of Sunnah

**Sunnah** linguistically: the way and conduct, whether good or bad.

**Sunnah** technically according to usulists: what emanated from the Prophet ﷺ in terms of speech, action, or approval.

### Categories of Sunnah

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Verbal (Qawliyya) | What the Prophet ﷺ said | "Actions are but by intentions" |
| Practical (Fi'liyya) | What the Prophet ﷺ did | The manner of praying and performing Hajj |
| Approving (Taqririyya) | What the Prophet ﷺ approved by silence or approval | His approval of eating lizard |

## Authority of the Prophetic Sunnah

### Evidence from the Quran

Allah the Most High says:

> **"And whatever the Messenger has given you - take; and what he has forbidden you - refrain from"** [Al-Hashr: 7]

> **"Say: If you love Allah, then follow me, Allah will love you"** [Al-Imran: 31]

> **"Nor does he speak from desire. It is not but a revelation revealed"** [An-Najm: 3-4]

### Evidence from the Sunnah

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **"Indeed, I have been given the Quran and something like it along with it"** [Reported by Abu Dawud]

### Consensus

The Ummah is unanimous on the obligation to follow the authentic Prophetic Sunnah.

## Position of the Sunnah in Relation to the Quran

### The Sunnah with the Quran

1. **Confirming the Quran**: like confirming the obligation of prayer and Zakat
2. **Explaining the Quran**: like explaining how to pray and perform Hajj
3. **Independent with new rulings**: like prohibiting marrying a woman and her aunt together

### Types of Explanation

| Type | Explanation | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Detailing the concise | Clarifying what is summarized in the Quran | Detailing the rules of prayer |
| Specifying the general | Limiting some individuals from the general | "No bequest for an heir" |
| Restricting the absolute | Adding a restriction to the absolute | Cutting the right hand in theft |

## Categories of Sunnah by Transmission

### Mutawatir (Mass-transmitted)

- **Definition**: what is reported by such a large number that their agreement on falsehood is impossible
- **Status**: provides certain knowledge
- **Example**: hadiths about the Basin (Hawd) and Intercession

### Ahad (Singular)

- **Definition**: what does not reach the level of tawatur
- **Status**: provides preponderant probability if its chain is authentic
- **Subdivisions**: well-known (mashhur), rare ('aziz), singular (gharib)

## Conditions for Accepting Hadith

### Conditions of Authenticity

1. **Continuity of chain**: no break in the chain of narrators
2. **Integrity of narrators**: they must be Muslim, adult, and sane
3. **Precision of narrators**: their memorization and mastery of the hadith
4. **Absence of anomaly**: the trustworthy not contradicting one more trustworthy
5. **Absence of hidden defect**: free from hidden invalidating defects

### Levels of Hadith

| Level | Definition | Status |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Sahih (Authentic) | Fulfills all conditions | Evidence to be followed |
| Hasan (Good) | Slightly diminished precision | Evidence to be followed |
| Da'if (Weak) | One condition unfulfilled | Not usable for rulings |
| Mawdu' (Fabricated) | Invented about the Prophet ﷺ | Forbidden to narrate except to warn |

## Legislative and Non-Legislative Sunnah

### What is Legislative

- Worship and legal rulings
- Ethics and commanded manners

### What is Not Legislative

- Purely worldly matters (like palm pollination)
- Instinctive acts (like the manner of eating and drinking)
- Prophetic specificities

## Relationship Between Sunnah and Ijtihad

### Did the Prophet ﷺ Perform Ijtihad?

- The majority hold that he could perform ijtihad in matters without revelation
- If he erred in ijtihad, revelation would descend to correct him

## Importance of Sunnah in Islamic Fiqh

- **The Quran cannot be understood without it**: as it is its practical explanation
- **Source of many rulings**: like detailed Zakat rules
- **Preserved by Allah**: through the efforts of scholars and their documentation

## Conclusion

The Prophetic Sunnah is the second source of legislation after the Quran, it is a binding evidence, explains and details the Quran and provides independent rulings, and the Muslim must follow it and act upon it.
