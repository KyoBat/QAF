# Al-Maslaha al-Mursala (Public Interest)

## Definition of Maslaha Mursala

**Maslaha Mursala** (المصلحة المرسلة) is an interest for which the Lawgiver has neither testified to its consideration nor its cancellation by a specific text, but which accords with the general objectives of the Sharia.

### Linguistic Definition

- **Maslaha**: opposite of mafsada (corruption), meaning bringing benefit or repelling harm
- **Mursala**: unrestricted, free, meaning it is not bound by a specific evidence

### Technical Definition

> Maslaha Mursala is: the benefit for which the Lawgiver has not legislated a ruling to achieve, and no legal evidence indicates its consideration or cancellation.

## Categories of Interests

Interests are divided into three categories according to the Lawgiver's consideration:

### 1. Recognized Interest (Al-Mu'tabara)

That which the Sharia has testified to its consideration by legislating a ruling to achieve it.

**Examples**:
- Preservation of life: thus retribution was legislated
- Preservation of wealth: thus theft was prohibited
- Preservation of intellect: thus wine was prohibited

### 2. Cancelled Interest (Al-Mulgha)

That which the Sharia has cancelled because it contradicts a text or consensus.

**Examples**:
- Equal inheritance between male and female (cancelled by text)
- Dropping the penalty from a rich thief (cancelled)

### 3. Unrestricted Interest (Al-Mursala)

That which the Lawgiver was silent about, neither recognizing nor cancelling it specifically.

**Examples**:
- Compiling the Quran into one book
- Establishing administrative registers
- Codifying hadith

## Conditions for Acting on Maslaha Mursala

### First Condition: Conformity with Sharia Objectives

The interest must be compatible with the general objectives of Islamic Sharia.

### Second Condition: Being Rational

The interest must be comprehensible and approved by sound reason.

### Third Condition: Being Real Not Illusory

The interest must be genuine, achieving benefit or repelling harm.

### Fourth Condition: Being General Not Particular

The interest must benefit all Muslims or most of them, not an individual or group.

### Fifth Condition: Not Contradicting Text or Consensus

The interest must not contradict an established legal proof.

## The Five Objectives of Sharia

Maslaha Mursala revolves around preserving the five necessities:

| Objective | What It Preserves | Examples of Maslaha Mursala |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Preservation of Religion | Belief and worship | Establishing Islamic schools |
| Preservation of Life | Life and health | Traffic regulations, vaccinations |
| Preservation of Intellect | Knowledge and thought | Mandatory education |
| Preservation of Lineage | Family and offspring | Regulating marriage contracts |
| Preservation of Wealth | Riches and property | Documentation and registry systems |

## Levels of Interests

### 1. Necessities (Al-Daruriyyat)

That without which religious and worldly interests cannot stand.

### 2. Needs (Al-Hajiyyat)

That which is needed for ease and removal of hardship, like dispensations in worship.

### 3. Refinements (Al-Tahsiniyyat)

That which aims at adopting good customs and noble character.

## Scholarly Positions on Maslaha Mursala

### Those Who Accept Its Authority

1. **Malikis**: The school that most extensively adopts it
2. **Hanbalis**: Accept it in many situations
3. **Some Shafi'is and Hanafis**: Within a narrow scope

### Their Arguments

1. People's interests are renewable and endless, while texts are finite
2. The Companions acted upon it: compiling the Quran, establishing registers
3. The Sharia came to bring benefits and repel harms

### Opponents

Some scholars were cautious about accepting it, fearing uncontrolled expansion.

## Contemporary Practical Examples

### In the Field of Transactions

| Issue | Realized Interest |
|-------|-------------------|
| Official contract documentation | Preserving rights and preventing disputes |
| Mandatory car insurance | Protecting victims |
| Financial market regulations | Preventing fraud and monopoly |

### In the Field of Governance

| Issue | Realized Interest |
|-------|-------------------|
| Establishing ministries and institutions | Organizing state affairs |
| Issuing passports | Regulating travel and border protection |
| Traffic laws | Preserving lives and property |

### In the Field of Education

| Issue | Realized Interest |
|-------|-------------------|
| Mandatory basic education | Eliminating ignorance and spreading knowledge |
| Degree accreditation | Controlling academic standards |
| Founding universities | Training competencies |

## Guidelines for Applying Maslaha Mursala

### First Guideline: Verification of Interest

The interest must be realized, not supposed or imaginary.

### Second Guideline: Balancing Interests and Harms

If interests conflict with harms, the predominant is examined.

**Principle**: Repelling harms takes precedence over bringing benefits.

### Third Guideline: Avoiding Uncontrolled Expansion

Istislah should not be used as a pretext to change established Sharia rulings.

### Fourth Guideline: Qualification of the Mujtahid

The one deriving the interest must be qualified for ijtihad and know the objectives of Sharia.

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf: Umar ibn al-Khattab and the Compilation of the Quran

When many reciters were martyred in the Battle of Yamama, Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) came to Abu Bakr al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) saying:

> "The killing has been severe at Yamama among the reciters of the Quran, and I fear that severe killing may befall the reciters in other places, and much of the Quran may be lost. I think you should order the collection of the Quran."

Abu Bakr hesitated at first, saying: **"How can we do something the Messenger of Allah ﷺ did not do?"**

But Umar kept persuading him until Allah expanded his chest for it, and Abu Bakr said: **"By Allah, it is good."**

They then assigned Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) this great task.

**The Lesson**: Compiling the Quran into one mushaf was not textually prescribed, but the Companions recognized the great interest in preserving the Book of Allah, so they acted upon it. This is one of the greatest examples of maslaha mursala in Islamic history.

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### Case 1: Mandatory Vaccinations

**Question**: Is it permissible for the state to require citizens to be vaccinated against epidemics?

**Answer**: Yes, this is permissible based on maslaha mursala in preserving life and public health. Vaccination achieves a general interest (protecting society from epidemics) and does not contradict a Sharia text; rather, it accords with the principle "no harm and no reciprocal harm."

---

### Case 2: Mandatory Contract Documentation

**Question**: Recently, documenting marriage contracts in courts has become mandatory. Is this legitimate even though it is not mentioned in the texts?

**Answer**: Yes, this obligation is legitimate based on maslaha mursala. It preserves the rights of spouses and children, prevents denial and manipulation, and facilitates proving lineage and inheritance. This achieves the Sharia's objective of preserving lineage and wealth.

---

### Case 3: Driving Licenses

**Question**: Cars did not exist during the time of legislation, so what is the ruling on requiring a license to drive?

**Answer**: This requirement is legitimate based on maslaha mursala in preserving lives and property. A car without a skilled driver could be a means of killing and destruction, and ensuring driver competence achieves the Sharia's objective of preserving lives.

---

### Case 4: Building and Urban Planning Regulations

**Question**: Is it permissible for the state to require citizens to follow certain specifications in construction?

**Answer**: Yes, this is permissible to preserve lives from building collapse, protect neighbors' rights, and organize public facilities. This is from maslaha mursala that achieves the preservation of life and property.

---

### Case 5: Personal Data Protection

**Question**: Are personal data protection laws considered maslaha mursala?

**Answer**: Yes, these laws preserve human privacy and prevent exploitation of their data, achieving the Sharia's objective of preserving honor and human dignity. Even though no specific text addresses them, they accord with general objectives.

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

> Reflect on your contemporary society: What systems and laws do you see as built on maslaha mursala? How do these laws achieve the objectives of Sharia in preserving religion, life, intellect, lineage, and wealth?

## Difference Between Maslaha Mursala and Istihsan

| Maslaha Mursala | Istihsan |
|-----------------|----------|
| Building ruling on general interest | Deviation from Qiyas for stronger evidence |
| No specific text | May have a text |
| Independent evidence | Exception to a rule |

## Conclusion

Maslaha Mursala is an important legal evidence that enables the jurist to perform ijtihad in new issues for which there is no specific text, while observing the guidelines of Sharia and its general objectives.
