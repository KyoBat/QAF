# Al-Maslaha al-Mursala (Public Interest)

## Definition of Maslaha Mursala

**Maslaha Mursala** (المصلحة المرسلة) is an interest for which the Lawgiver has neither testified to its consideration nor its cancellation by a specific text, but which accords with the general objectives of the Sharia.

### Linguistic Definition

- **Maslaha**: opposite of mafsada (corruption), meaning bringing benefit or repelling harm
- **Mursala**: unrestricted, free, meaning it is not bound by a specific evidence

### Technical Definition

> Maslaha Mursala is: the benefit for which the Lawgiver has not legislated a ruling to achieve, and no legal evidence indicates its consideration or cancellation.

## Categories of Interests

Interests are divided into three categories according to the Lawgiver's consideration:

### 1. Recognized Interest (Al-Mu'tabara)

That which the Sharia has testified to its consideration by legislating a ruling to achieve it.

**Examples**:
- Preservation of life: thus retribution was legislated
- Preservation of wealth: thus theft was prohibited
- Preservation of intellect: thus wine was prohibited

### 2. Cancelled Interest (Al-Mulgha)

That which the Sharia has cancelled because it contradicts a text or consensus.

**Examples**:
- Equal inheritance between male and female (cancelled by text)
- Dropping the penalty from a rich thief (cancelled)

### 3. Unrestricted Interest (Al-Mursala)

That which the Lawgiver was silent about, neither recognizing nor cancelling it specifically.

**Examples**:
- Compiling the Quran into one book
- Establishing administrative registers
- Codifying hadith

## Conditions for Acting on Maslaha Mursala

### First Condition: Conformity with Sharia Objectives

The interest must be compatible with the general objectives of Islamic Sharia.

### Second Condition: Being Rational

The interest must be comprehensible and approved by sound reason.

### Third Condition: Being Real Not Illusory

The interest must be genuine, achieving benefit or repelling harm.

### Fourth Condition: Being General Not Particular

The interest must benefit all Muslims or most of them, not an individual or group.

### Fifth Condition: Not Contradicting Text or Consensus

The interest must not contradict an established legal proof.

## The Five Objectives of Sharia

Maslaha Mursala revolves around preserving the five necessities:

| Objective | What It Preserves | Examples of Maslaha Mursala |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Preservation of Religion | Belief and worship | Establishing Islamic schools |
| Preservation of Life | Life and health | Traffic regulations, vaccinations |
| Preservation of Intellect | Knowledge and thought | Mandatory education |
| Preservation of Lineage | Family and offspring | Regulating marriage contracts |
| Preservation of Wealth | Riches and property | Documentation and registry systems |

## Levels of Interests

### 1. Necessities (Al-Daruriyyat)

That without which religious and worldly interests cannot stand.

### 2. Needs (Al-Hajiyyat)

That which is needed for ease and removal of hardship, like dispensations in worship.

### 3. Refinements (Al-Tahsiniyyat)

That which aims at adopting good customs and noble character.

## Scholarly Positions on Maslaha Mursala

### Those Who Accept Its Authority

1. **Malikis**: The school that most extensively adopts it
2. **Hanbalis**: Accept it in many situations
3. **Some Shafi'is and Hanafis**: Within a narrow scope

### Their Arguments

1. People's interests are renewable and endless, while texts are finite
2. The Companions acted upon it: compiling the Quran, establishing registers
3. The Sharia came to bring benefits and repel harms

### Opponents

Some scholars were cautious about accepting it, fearing uncontrolled expansion.

## Contemporary Practical Examples

## Guidelines for Applying Maslaha Mursala

### First Guideline: Verification of Interest

The interest must be realized, not supposed or imaginary.

### Second Guideline: Balancing Interests and Harms

If interests conflict with harms, the predominant is examined.

**Principle**: Repelling harms takes precedence over bringing benefits.

### Third Guideline: Avoiding Uncontrolled Expansion

Istislah should not be used as a pretext to change established Sharia rulings.

### Fourth Guideline: Qualification of the Mujtahid

The one deriving the interest must be qualified for ijtihad and know the objectives of Sharia.

## Difference Between Maslaha Mursala and Istihsan

| Maslaha Mursala | Istihsan |
|-----------------|----------|
| Building ruling on general interest | Deviation from Qiyas for stronger evidence |
| No specific text | May have a text |
| Independent evidence | Exception to a rule |

## Conclusion

Maslaha Mursala is an important legal evidence that enables the jurist to perform ijtihad in new issues for which there is no specific text, while observing the guidelines of Sharia and its general objectives.
