# Ijtihad (Juristic Effort)

## Introduction

Ijtihad is one of the most important chapters in Islamic legal theory. It is the means by which legal rulings are derived from their sources. Allah has made it an open door for extracting rulings concerning new situations and contemporary developments.

## Definition of Ijtihad

**Linguistically:** Exerting effort and capacity to accomplish something.

**Technically:** The effort exerted by the jurist to derive practical legal rulings from their detailed evidences.

Imam Ash-Shafi'i said: "Ijtihad is for the scholar to exert all his efforts in seeking the ruling."

## Legitimacy of Ijtihad

### From the Quran:
Allah says: ﴿So take a lesson, O you who have insight﴾ [Al-Hashr: 2]

And: ﴿If they had referred it to the Messenger and to those of authority among them, those who can derive rulings from it would have known it﴾ [An-Nisa: 83]

### From the Sunnah:
The hadith of Mu'adh ibn Jabal when the Prophet ﷺ sent him to Yemen. He asked him: "How will you judge if a matter is presented to you?" He said: I will judge by the Book of Allah. He said: "And if you do not find it?" He said: Then by the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah. He said: "And if you do not find it?" He said: I will exert my effort and spare no effort. The Prophet ﷺ struck his chest and said: "Praise be to Allah who has guided the messenger of the Messenger of Allah to what pleases the Messenger of Allah."

### From Consensus:
The scholars are unanimous on the legitimacy of ijtihad and that it is a collective obligation upon the community.

   - But differs from him in some branches
   - Example: Al-Muzani among the Shafi'is

   - Example: An-Nawawi in the Shafi'i school

4. **The fatwa mujtahid:**
   - One who issues fatwas according to what the scholars of their school have preferred

### According to subject:

1. **Ijtihad in understanding the text:**
   - Interpretation of verses and hadiths
   - Understanding their intent

2. **Ijtihad in verification of the cause (tahqiq al-manat):**
   - Applying the general ruling to particular cases
   - Example: determining who is the poor person deserving zakat

3. **Ijtihad in refining the cause (tanqih al-manat):**

## Ethics of the Mujtahid

1. **Sincerity to Allah:** in seeking the truth

## Change of Ijtihad

The mujtahid may change their ijtihad if:

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf

**Umar's Ijtihad Regarding the Land of Sawad**

When the Muslims conquered Iraq during the caliphate of Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), some Companions demanded that the lands be divided among the fighters, as was done with the spoils of Khaybar.

Bilal ibn Rabah and Abd ar-Rahman ibn Awf said: "Divide it among us, O Commander of the Faithful."

But Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) exercised unique ijtihad and said: "If I were to divide it, nothing would remain for those who come after you, and you would find a single man owning an entire village."

Then he cited Allah's words: ﴿And those who came after them﴾ and said: "This verse includes those Muslims who come after them, so how can I divide what is rightfully theirs?"

So he left the land to its people and imposed the kharaj tax on them for the Muslim treasury, so that all generations would benefit.

**The Lesson**: Sound ijtihad considers the public interest and the objectives of the Law. Scholars may differ in their ijtihad while maintaining mutual respect.

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### Case One: The Ruling on Cryptocurrencies

**Question:** Is it permissible to deal with cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin) in buying, selling, and investing?

**Answer:** Contemporary scholars have differed on this:
- **Those who prohibit** argue there is excessive uncertainty (gharar), no guarantor, and it is a means for gambling
- **Those who permit** argue it is valued property with market value, and the default in transactions is permissibility
- **Those who restrict** allow it for transactions but not speculation, or within specific guidelines

This issue is among the new matters requiring collective ijtihad from specialists in both jurisprudence and economics.

### Case Two: Friday Prayer via Live Broadcast

**Question:** Is the Friday prayer valid behind an imam broadcast via the internet during quarantine?

**Answer:** Scholars exercised ijtihad on this new matter:
- **The majority** hold it invalid because of the requirement of unity of place and connection of rows
- **Some councils** issued rulings permitting praying Zuhr instead under exceptional circumstances
- **Others** held that necessity is assessed according to its measure, so one prays Zuhr at home

Conclusion: Friday prayer via broadcast is not valid, but the quarantined person is excused to pray Zuhr.

### Case Three: Organ Donation

**Question:** What is the ruling on organ donation after death or during life?

**Answer:**
- **During life:** Donating what does not lead to death or severe harm (like a kidney) is permissible if there is reasonable expectation of successful operation
- **After death:** The majority of fiqh academies have permitted this with conditions:
  1. The deceased's permission before death or the heirs' permission
  2. That it be to save a life or essential organ
  3. That it not be for monetary compensation (selling organs is forbidden)

---

### Case Four: Zakat on Stocks and Investment Funds

**Question:** How is zakat calculated on stocks and investment funds?

**Answer:** Scholars have exercised ijtihad on this:
- **Trading stocks (for speculation):** Zakat is on the market value at the time of the lunar year (2.5%)
- **Long-term investment stocks:** Some hold zakat is only on distributed profits; others on market value
- **Investment funds:** Treated like trade goods

---

### Case Five: Ruling on AI in Issuing Fatwas

**Question:** Is it permissible to rely on AI programs in issuing fatwas?

**Answer:**
- **Not permissible** for AI to be an independent source of fatwa, because ijtihad requires the qualification of a human mujtahid
- **Permissible** to use it as an assistive tool for the mufti in research and gathering evidence and opinions
- **Verification is required** because these programs may err or confuse opinions

Knowledge is taken from scholars, not from machines.

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

> **Question for Reflection:**
>
> Imam Ahmad said: "One who issues fatwas to people should not force them upon his school of thought or be harsh with them."
>
> How do you balance between adhering to what you consider most probable and respecting the ijtihad of other scholars in disputed matters? What is the effect of understanding ijtihad on your dealing with juristic differences?

---

## Conclusion

Ijtihad is a noble act of worship and a great responsibility. It is not permissible for the unqualified to engage in it, and it is not permissible to close its door because it is a legal necessity to face new developments and solve problems in light of Islamic law.
