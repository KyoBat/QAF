>
> A woman was brought to **Ali ibn Abi Talib** — may Allah be pleased with him — who gave birth six months after marriage.
>
> Her husband accused her of zina!
>
> Ali ruled:
>
> **"The minimum pregnancy is six months!"**
>
> They asked: *"How did you know?"*
>
> Ali answered, combining two verses:
>
> **﴿ And his gestation and weaning is thirty months ﴾** + **﴿ And weaning is two years ﴾**
>

### 🎭 Scene: Ibn Abbas and Inheritance
