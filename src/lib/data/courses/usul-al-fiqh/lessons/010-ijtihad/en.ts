# Ijtihad (Juristic Effort)

## Introduction

Ijtihad is one of the most important chapters in Islamic legal theory. It is the means by which legal rulings are derived from their sources. Allah has made it an open door for extracting rulings concerning new situations and contemporary developments.

## Definition of Ijtihad

**Linguistically:** Exerting effort and capacity to accomplish something.

**Technically:** The effort exerted by the jurist to derive practical legal rulings from their detailed evidences.

Imam Ash-Shafi'i said: "Ijtihad is for the scholar to exert all his efforts in seeking the ruling."

## Legitimacy of Ijtihad

### From the Quran:
Allah says: ﴿So take a lesson, O you who have insight﴾ [Al-Hashr: 2]

And: ﴿If they had referred it to the Messenger and to those of authority among them, those who can derive rulings from it would have known it﴾ [An-Nisa: 83]

### From the Sunnah:
The hadith of Mu'adh ibn Jabal when the Prophet ﷺ sent him to Yemen. He asked him: "How will you judge if a matter is presented to you?" He said: I will judge by the Book of Allah. He said: "And if you do not find it?" He said: Then by the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah. He said: "And if you do not find it?" He said: I will exert my effort and spare no effort. The Prophet ﷺ struck his chest and said: "Praise be to Allah who has guided the messenger of the Messenger of Allah to what pleases the Messenger of Allah."

### From Consensus:
The scholars are unanimous on the legitimacy of ijtihad and that it is a collective obligation upon the community.

   - Has their own foundations and methodology
   - Example: the four Imams

   - But differs from him in some branches
   - Example: Al-Muzani among the Shafi'is

3. **The school mujtahid:**

   - Example: An-Nawawi in the Shafi'i school

4. **The fatwa mujtahid:**
   - One who issues fatwas according to what the scholars of their school have preferred

### According to subject:

1. **Ijtihad in understanding the text:**
   - Interpretation of verses and hadiths
   - Understanding their intent

2. **Ijtihad in verification of the cause (tahqiq al-manat):**
   - Applying the general ruling to particular cases
   - Example: determining who is the poor person deserving zakat

3. **Ijtihad in refining the cause (tanqih al-manat):**
   - Determining the cause from among several characteristics

## Scope of Ijtihad

### What is permissible for ijtihad:
- Matters without definitive text
- Matters without consensus
- New situations and developments
- Applying texts to realities

### What is not permissible for ijtihad:
- What is established by definitive text in authenticity and meaning
- What is subject to consensus
- Fundamentals of creed and defined acts of worship
- What is necessarily known of the religion

## Ruling on Ijtihad

**Collective obligation:** If some perform it, others are exempted.

The Prophet ﷺ said: "If the judge makes an effort and is correct, he has two rewards; and if he makes an effort and errs, he has one reward."

## Ethics of the Mujtahid

1. **Sincerity to Allah:** in seeking the truth
2. **Freedom from desires:** and fanaticism of opinion
3. **Verification and patience:** before issuing a ruling
4. **Returning to truth:** when it becomes clear
5. **Humility:** without arrogance from knowledge
6. **Consulting scholars:** in difficult matters

## Change of Ijtihad

The mujtahid may change their ijtihad if:
- A new evidence appears
- An error in understanding the previous evidence becomes clear
- The circumstances of the matter change

Imam Ash-Shafi'i said: "If the hadith is authentic, it is my school."

### Its conditions:
- Collective ijtihad through fiqh academies
- Recourse to specialists in each field

## Conclusion

Ijtihad is a noble act of worship and a great responsibility. It is not permissible for the unqualified to engage in it, and it is not permissible to close its door because it is a legal necessity to face new developments and solve problems in light of Islamic law.
