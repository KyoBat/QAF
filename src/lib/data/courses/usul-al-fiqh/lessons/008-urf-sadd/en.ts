# Al-'Urf and Sadd al-Dhara'i (Custom and Blocking Pretexts)

## Part One: Al-'Urf (Custom)

### Definition of 'Urf

**'Urf** (العرف) is what people have become accustomed to and follow in speech, action, or abstention, until it becomes familiar among them.

#### Linguistic Definition

- **'Urf** linguistically means: what people know and are accustomed to
- Also called: al-'ada (custom) or general usage

#### Technical Definition

> 'Urf is: what has become established in minds through the testimony of intellects, and which sound natures have received with acceptance.

### Types of 'Urf

#### According to Source

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Verbal 'Urf | People's convention on using a term with a specific meaning | Using "meat" to mean other than fish |
| Practical 'Urf | What people habitually do | Sale by exchange without verbal formula |

#### According to Scope

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| General 'Urf | What most people do | Giving the dowry before the wedding |
| Particular 'Urf | What people of a country or profession do | Terminology of merchants in a specific country |

#### According to Sharia's Consideration

| Type | Definition | Ruling |
|------|------------|--------|
| Valid 'Urf | What does not contradict a legal text | Legally considered |
| Corrupt 'Urf | What contradicts the Sharia | Cancelled and not considered |

### Conditions for Considering 'Urf

#### First Condition: Being Constant or Predominant

The 'urf must be continuous and not intermittent, predominant and not rare.

#### Second Condition: Existing at the Time of the Act

The 'urf must be present at the time of establishing the act or contract.

#### Third Condition: Not Contradicting Text or Consensus

The 'urf must not oppose an established legal proof.

#### Fourth Condition: Not Contradicting an Explicit Condition

The 'urf must not contradict what the contracting parties explicitly stipulated.

### Legal Maxims Related to 'Urf

| Maxim | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Custom is authoritative | 'Urf is referred to in determining rulings |
| What is known by custom is like what is stipulated | What people customarily do is as if stipulated |
| The literal meaning is abandoned by indication of custom | The literal meaning is left if custom says otherwise |
| Determination by custom is like determination by text | What custom determines is as if determined by text |
| Change of rulings by change of times is not denied | Rulings based on custom change with it |

### Practical Examples of 'Urf

#### In Contracts

| Issue | Ruling | Reasoning |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Currency in sale | Refers to the country's currency | Custom determines the currency |
| Unmentioned rent | The customary equivalent rent | Custom determines the amount |
| Profit sharing | According to merchants' custom | Commercial custom is considered |

#### In Expressions

| Issue | Ruling | Reasoning |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Swearing not to eat meat | Does not violate with fish | Custom excludes fish from meat |
| Waqf for children | Includes males and females | Custom of usage |

### Change of 'Urf and Its Effect

If 'urf changes, the ruling based on it changes:

**Maxim**: Change of rulings by change of times is not denied

**Example**: What was considered a defect in merchandise in the past may not be considered so today, and vice versa.

## Part Two: Sadd al-Dhara'i (Blocking Pretexts)

### Definition of Sadd al-Dhara'i

**Sadd al-Dhara'i** (سد الذرائع) is prohibiting what serves as a path to the forbidden, even if it is originally permissible.

#### Linguistic Definition

- **Dhari'a**: the means to something
- **Sadduha**: blocking and closing it

#### Technical Definition

> Sadd al-Dhara'i: prohibiting what appears to lead to the permissible if it leads to the forbidden generally or frequently.

### Categories of Dhara'i

#### According to Ruling

| Category | Definition | Ruling | Example |
|----------|------------|--------|---------|
| What certainly leads to harm | Means that inevitably leads to forbidden | Prohibited by consensus | Digging a well behind a door in darkness |
| What generally leads to harm | Means that often leads to forbidden | Prohibited | Selling weapons during strife |
| What rarely leads to harm | Means that rarely leads to forbidden | Not prohibited | Growing grapes |
| What is equal both ways | Equal probability of harm and benefit | Disagreement among scholars | 'Ina sale |

### Proofs of the Authority of Sadd al-Dhara'i

#### From the Quran

1. ﴿Do not insult those they invoke besides Allah, lest they insult Allah in hostility without knowledge﴾
   - Prohibition of insulting idols as it's a means to insulting Allah

2. ﴿O you who believe, do not say "Ra'ina"﴾
   - Prohibition of a permissible word because Jews used it for insult

#### From the Sunnah

1. "May Allah curse the Jews and Christians who took the graves of their prophets as mosques"
   - Warning against the means to shirk

2. The Prophet ﷺ prohibited killing the hypocrites
   - To block the means of saying: Muhammad kills his companions

#### From the Companions' Actions

1. 'Umar prohibited selling mothers of children
2. He prohibited combining three divorces in one utterance

### Schools' Positions on Sadd al-Dhara'i

| School | Position |
|--------|----------|
| Malikis | The school that adopts it most |
| Hanbalis | Adopt it extensively |
| Shafi'is | Adopt it in some cases |
| Hanafis | Adopt it in some cases |

### Practical Examples of Sadd al-Dhara'i

#### In Worship

| Issue | Ruling | Reasoning |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Prohibition of praying near graves | Disliked or forbidden | Blocking the means to shirk |
| Disliking fasting the day of doubt | Disliked | Blocking the means of adding to the obligation |

#### In Transactions

| Issue | Ruling | Reasoning |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Selling grapes to one who makes wine | Forbidden | Blocking the means of helping in forbidden |
| Selling weapons during strife | Forbidden | Blocking the means of killing |
| 'Ina and tawarruq sales | Disagreement | As they are means to usury |

#### In Social Relations

| Issue | Ruling | Reasoning |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Being alone with a foreign woman | Forbidden | Blocking the means to fornication |
| Shaking hands with a foreign woman | Disagreement | Blocking the means of temptation |

### Opening of Means (Fath al-Dhara'i)

Just as means are blocked, they are also opened:

**Fath al-Dhara'i**: Permitting what leads to benefit even if originally prohibited.

**Examples**:
- Permission to look at the fiancee (otherwise looking is forbidden)
- Permission to uncover the 'awra for the doctor for treatment

### Difference Between Sadd al-Dhara'i and Maslaha Mursala

| Sadd al-Dhara'i | Maslaha Mursala |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Preventing what leads to harm | Achieving what brings benefit |
| Focus on means | Focus on objectives |
| Negative (preventing) | Positive (achieving) |

### Guidelines for Sadd al-Dhara'i

1. **Verify that the means leads to harm**: Only what generally leads is prohibited
2. **Balance between interests and harms**: If the interest is greater, it's not prohibited
3. **Avoid exaggeration**: So as not to prohibit permissible things

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf

### Ibn Abbas and Custom in Dowries

A man came to Abdullah ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) asking about his wife's dowry. The man said: "I married her without specifying a dowry, so what is required of me?"

Ibn Abbas asked him: **"What is the dowry of similar women from your people?"**

The man replied: "Such and such amount."

Ibn Abbas said: **"She gets the dowry of her peers—no less and no more."**

**The Lesson**: Ibn Abbas referred to custom to determine the equivalent dowry, showing that the Companions considered custom in rulings related to transactions and social relationships.

### Umar ibn al-Khattab and Blocking the Means to Shirk

Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) saw people seeking blessings from the tree under which the Companions pledged allegiance to the Prophet ﷺ at the Pledge of Ridwan. He ordered it cut down, saying:

**"What destroyed the Children of Israel was that they followed the traces of their prophets and made them into churches and monasteries."**

**The Lesson**: Umar cut down the blessed tree to block the means to shirk, even though seeking blessings from it was not prohibited in itself. However, he feared that the matter would evolve into worshiping the tree, so he blocked the means before it led to corruption.

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### Case One (Custom): Currencies of Different Countries

**Question**: If a price is stated in a contract without specifying the currency, what currency is considered?

**Answer**: Reference is made to the custom of the country. If the contract is in Saudi Arabia, the price is in riyals. If in Egypt, the price is in pounds. The maxim is: **"What is known by custom is like what is stipulated."**

---

### Case Two (Custom): Changing Concept of Defects in Goods

**Question**: In the past, custom held that a small scratch on a car was not a defect, but today's custom has changed. What is the ruling?

**Answer**: The ruling changes with the change in custom. The maxim is: **"The change of rulings by the change of times is not denied."** What is considered a defect by modern custom is treated as a defect giving the right to rescission, even if it was not so previously.

---

### Case Three (Blocking Means): Being Alone in the Workplace

**Question**: What is the ruling on a man being alone with a woman in the office?

**Answer**: Being alone with a non-mahram woman is prohibited to block the means to temptation. It is recommended that the office door be open or made of glass, or that a third person be present, to prevent what such seclusion may lead to.

---

### Case Four (Blocking Means): Selling Chemical Materials

**Question**: What is the ruling on selling chemical materials that may be used to manufacture drugs?

**Answer**: If the seller has reasonable grounds to believe that the buyer will use them for unlawful purposes, the sale is prohibited to block the means of assisting in the forbidden. This is similar to selling weapons during strife.

---

### Case Five (Custom and Blocking Means): Gifts to Employees

**Question**: What is the ruling on a public employee accepting gifts from clients?

**Answer**: The origin of gifts is permissibility, but for a public employee, they may become a means to bribery and favoritism. The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Gifts to officials are embezzlement."** They are therefore prohibited to block the means, even though originally permissible.

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

> Custom changes with place and time, and rulings based on it change accordingly. Think of three customs that have changed in your society over the past decades. How has that change affected the legal rulings related to them? Does every change in custom necessarily require a change in ruling?

---

## Conclusion

'Urf and Sadd al-Dhara'i are two important evidences that take into account people's reality and the consequences of actions, enabling the jurist to reach rulings that achieve the objectives of Sharia in bringing benefits and repelling harms.
