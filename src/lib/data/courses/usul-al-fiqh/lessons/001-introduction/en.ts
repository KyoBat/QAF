## 🎬 Introduction

### 🎭 Scene: Imam Ash-Shafi'i and the Birth of a New Science

> **Egypt, 199 AH...**
>
> **Imam Ash-Shafi'i** — may Allah have mercy on him — sat in his teaching circle, surrounded by students from Iraq and Egypt.
>
> One of them asked: *"O Imam, why did Abu Hanifa and Malik differ? They are both great imams!"*
>
> Ash-Shafi'i smiled and said:
>
> **"Their disagreement is a mercy. But one who doesn't know the foundations of reasoning cannot understand why they differed."**
>
> The student said: *"Then teach us, O Imam!"*
>
> Ash-Shafi'i took out pages he had written and said:
>
> **"This is 'Ar-Risala'... the first book on the science of Usul al-Fiqh."**

> 🎯 **Thus the science of Usul al-Fiqh was born — to organize ijtihad and regulate legal deduction!**

---

### 🎭 Scene: The Firewood and the Snake

> A student asked Ash-Shafi'i: *"Leave the rules aside and just give us the rulings directly!"*
>
> Imam Ash-Shafi'i replied:
>
> **"One who seeks fiqh without usul is like one who carries firewood at night with a snake hidden inside!"**

> ⚠️ **Fiqh without usul = danger!**
