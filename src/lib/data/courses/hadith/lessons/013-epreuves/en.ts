## 1. Introduction and Context

### Divine Wisdom in Trials

This fundamental hadith provides essential insight into the Islamic view of trials and life's difficulties. It reveals a consoling truth: nothing that befalls the believer is wasted in Allah's sight. Every difficulty, no matter how small, becomes an opportunity for the expiation of sins.

The Prophet ﷺ taught this hadith to transform believers' perception of trials. What appears to be a misfortune actually becomes a hidden mercy, a purification of the soul, and a lightening of the burden of sins.

This message is particularly comforting because it encompasses all forms of difficulties, from major trials to minor daily inconveniences, including even the prick of a thorn.

## 5. In-Depth Explanation (Sharh)

### Imam An-Nawawi رحمه الله

In his commentary on Sahih Muslim, An-Nawawi explains:

> "This hadith is one of the great foundations of Islam and most consoling for believers. It shows that every trial, whatever its nature, becomes a source of good for the patient Muslim. The detailed enumeration of different types of difficulties aims to include all possible situations."

> "The mention of the thorn at the end is remarkably eloquent: if even this insignificant prick erases sins, what about major trials?"

### Imam Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalani رحمه الله

In Fath al-Bārī, Ibn Hajar develops:

> "This hadith specifically concerns minor sins (الصغائر). As for major sins (الكبائر), they require sincere repentance (توبة نصوح). However, some scholars have said that if the trials are very great and accompanied by exemplary patience, they can expiate even major sins."

> "The expression 'حَتَّى الشَّوْكَة' (even the thorn) indicates the minimum degree of trial, to show that Allah does not neglect any pain."

### Imam Ibn al-Qayyim رحمه الله

In his works, Ibn al-Qayyim clarifies:

> "Trials for the servant are of several types: some elevate him in rank, others expiate his sins, others bring him closer to Allah through patience. The wise believer is the one who sees in every trial an opportunity for purification and drawing near."

### Imam Al-Qurtubi رحمه الله

Al-Qurtubi adds:

> "The wisdom in trials is multiple: they remind the servant of his weakness, distance him from arrogance, make him know the true value of blessings, and purify him of his sins. Whoever understands this finds in the trial a form of hidden grace."
