## 1. Introduction and Context

### The Prophet ﷺ and the Teaching of Trust in Allah

This fundamental hadith was reported by 'Umar ibn al-Khattāb رضي الله عنه, the second Rightly Guided Caliph, known for his strength, intelligence, and profound understanding of Islam. He transmits this essential prophetic teaching on the true nature of tawakkul (trust in Allah).

The Prophet ﷺ loved to use concrete examples from nature to illustrate spiritual truths. The image of birds leaving with empty stomachs and returning satisfied is particularly eloquent and accessible to all levels of understanding.

This hadith corrects a misconception about tawakkul that would consist of total passivity, by showing that even the birds, though their sustenance is guaranteed by Allah, must go out to seek it.

## 5. In-Depth Explanation (Sharh)

### Imam Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali رحمه الله

In Jāmi' al-'Ulūm wal-Ḥikam, Ibn Rajab explains:

> "This hadith establishes a fundamental truth: authentic tawakkul necessarily involves taking the means while entrusting the result to Allah. The birds perfectly illustrate this principle because they do not stay in their nests waiting for food to fall from the sky, but they actively go out to seek it from dawn."

> "The Prophet ﷺ said 'ḥaqqa tawakkulih' (true reliance) to indicate that many people claim to have tawakkul but do not truly realize it. True tawakkul combines trust of the heart with action of the limbs."

### Imam An-Nawawi رحمه الله

An-Nawawi comments:

> "This hadith refutes the idea that tawakkul consists of abandoning means. On the contrary, it shows that even the weakest creatures (birds) are not exempt from effort. How then could man, endowed with intelligence and superior capabilities, be exempt from taking the means?"

### Imam Al-Mubarakfuri رحمه الله

In Tuḥfat al-Aḥwadhī, he clarifies:

> "The participle 'taghdū' (they go out in the morning) proves that departure is indispensable. If waiting were sufficient, Allah could have said 'they stay and are fed.' But He wanted to show that sustenance is linked to effort while still being a gift from Allah."

### Imam Ibn al-Qayyim رحمه الله

In Madārij as-Sālikīn, Ibn al-Qayyim develops:

> "Tawakkul rests on two essential pillars: trust in Allah (i'timād al-qalb) and taking the means (al-akhdh bil-asbāb). Whoever neglects one of the two pillars has deficient tawakkul. Some neglect effort and call it tawakkul—this is in reality laziness. Others take the means but forget to rely on Allah—this is hidden shirk."

## 6. The Three Levels of Tawakkul

### 1. Deficient Tawakkul

- Relying solely on material causes
- Forgetting that Allah is the true Provider
- Excessive anxiety about sustenance
- Trust only in one's own capabilities

### 2. Excessive Tawakkul (Misunderstood)

- Totally abandoning the means
- Passively waiting for divine provision
- Confusing tawakkul with laziness
- Neglecting the obligations of effort

### 3. True Tawakkul (Balanced)

- Taking the means with the body
- Relying on Allah with the heart
- Knowing that the result belongs to Allah alone
- Being content with the divine decree

## 7. The Example of Birds: Profound Lessons

### Why Birds?

The Prophet ﷺ chose the example of birds for several reasons:

1. **Apparent weakness**: Birds are fragile but always provided for
2. **Constant effort**: They go out EVERY morning to seek their food
3. **Natural trust**: They do not hoard excessively
4. **Simplicity**: They are content with what Allah gives them

### Lessons Drawn

| Bird's Behavior | Lesson for the Believer |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Goes out in the morning | Start early, be active |
| Leaves with empty stomach | Accept moments of lack |
| Returns satisfied | Have confidence in the result |
| Does not hoard | Avoid excessive attachment to wealth |
| Repeats daily | Persevere in effort |

## 9. Tawakkul and Sustenance: The Relationship

### The Divine Guarantee

Allah تعالى says:

<div dir="rtl" lang="ar">
وَمَا مِن دَابَّةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ إِلَّا عَلَى اللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا
</div>

"And there is no creature on earth but that upon Allah is its provision." [Hūd: 6]

### Human Effort

Allah تعالى also says:

<div dir="rtl" lang="ar">
هُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ ذَلُولًا فَامْشُوا فِي مَنَاكِبِهَا وَكُلُوا مِن رِّزْقِهِ
</div>

"It is He who made the earth tame for you - so walk among its slopes and eat of His provision." [Al-Mulk: 15]

### The Perfect Balance

The believer understands that:
1. Sustenance is GUARANTEED by Allah
2. Effort is REQUIRED by Allah
3. The result is DECREED by Allah

## 11. Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Confusing Tawakkul with Passivity

**False conception**: "I have tawakkul, so I don't need to work."

**Correction**: The Prophet ﷺ himself worked, traded, and fought.

### Mistake 2: Anxiety Despite Efforts

**Problem**: Working but being constantly worried about sustenance.

**Solution**: Strengthen faith in Ar-Razzāq.

### Mistake 3: Depending Only on Causes

**Problem**: Believing that efforts alone guarantee the result.

**Solution**: Remember that causes only work by Allah's permission.

### Mistake 4: Testing Allah

**Problem**: Abandoning causes to "test" if Allah will provide.

**Solution**: Understand that this is forbidden and contrary to tawakkul.
