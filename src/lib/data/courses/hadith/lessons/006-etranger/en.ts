## 📖 Text of the Hadith (متن الحديث)

### 🔷 Arabic Text with Full Tashkil

عَنْ **عَبْدِ اللهِ بْنِ عُمَرَ** رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُمَا قَالَ: أَخَذَ رَسُولُ اللهِ ﷺ بِمَنْكِبِي فَقَالَ:

**« كُنْ فِي الدُّنْيَا كَأَنَّكَ غَرِيبٌ، أَوْ عَابِرُ سَبِيلٍ »**

وَكَانَ ابْنُ عُمَرَ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُمَا يَقُولُ:

**« إِذَا أَمْسَيْتَ فَلَا تَنْتَظِرِ الصَّبَاحَ، وَإِذَا أَصْبَحْتَ فَلَا تَنْتَظِرِ الْمَسَاءَ، وَخُذْ مِنْ صِحَّتِكَ لِمَرَضِكَ، وَمِنْ حَيَاتِكَ لِمَوْتِكَ »**

### 🔷 English Translation

On the authority of **Abdullah ibn 'Umar** — may Allah be pleased with them both — who said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ took hold of my shoulder and said:

**"Be in this world as if you were a stranger or a traveler passing through."**

And Ibn 'Umar — may Allah be pleased with him — used to say:

**"When evening comes, do not expect to see the morning, and when morning comes, do not expect to see the evening. Take from your health for your sickness, and from your life for your death."**
