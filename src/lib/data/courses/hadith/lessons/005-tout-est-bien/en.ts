## 📖 Text of the Hadith (متن الحديث)

### 🔷 Arabic Text with Full Tashkil

عَنْ **صُهَيْبِ بْنِ سِنَانٍ** رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ قَالَ: قَالَ رَسُولُ اللهِ ﷺ:

**« عَجَبًا لِأَمْرِ الْمُؤْمِنِ، إِنَّ أَمْرَهُ كُلَّهُ خَيْرٌ، وَلَيْسَ ذَاكَ لِأَحَدٍ إِلَّا لِلْمُؤْمِنِ، إِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ سَرَّاءُ شَكَرَ فَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَهُ، وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ ضَرَّاءُ صَبَرَ فَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَهُ »**

### 🔷 English Translation

On the authority of **Suhayb ibn Sinan** — may Allah be pleased with him — the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:

**"How amazing is the affair of the believer! All of his affairs are good, and this is not the case for anyone except the believer: If something good happens to him, he is grateful, and that is good for him; and if something bad happens to him, he is patient, and that is good for him."**

| 3️⃣ | **Two essential pillars** | Shukr and Sabr are the keys to this equation |
| 4️⃣ | **No losing situation** | The believer always wins |
