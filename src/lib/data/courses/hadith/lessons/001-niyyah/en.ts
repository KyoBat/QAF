I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say:

**« إِنَّمَا الأَعْمَالُ بِالنِّيَّاتِ، وَإِنَّمَا لِكُلِّ امْرِئٍ مَا نَوَى.**

**فَمَنْ كَانَتْ هِجْرَتُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ، فَهِجْرَتُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ.**

**وَمَنْ كَانَتْ هِجْرَتُهُ لِدُنْيَا يُصِيبُهَا، أَوِ امْرَأَةٍ يَنْكِحُهَا، فَهِجْرَتُهُ إِلَى مَا هَاجَرَ إِلَيْهِ. »**

|--------|-------------|
| **Linguistically** | القصد — The aim, the purpose |
| **Legally** | The heart's determination to perform an act of worship seeking closeness to Allah |
| **Location** | The heart (not the tongue) |

#### ⚠️ Pronouncing the Intention (التلفظ بالنية)

| School | Ruling |
|--------|--------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | ❌ **Bid'ah** — Pronouncing is not legislated |
| 🟢 **Hanafi** | ⚪ Permissible but not recommended |
| 🔵 **Shafi'i** | ⚪ Recommended by some to help concentration |
| 🟣 **Hanbali** | ❌ Not legislated |

> **Strongest opinion**: The intention is in the **heart**, not on the tongue. The Prophet ﷺ never pronounced his intention aloud.

### 2️⃣ "وَإِنَّمَا لِكُلِّ امْرِئٍ مَا نَوَى"

This statement establishes:

| Principle | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Personal reward** | Each person is rewarded according to **their own** intention |
| **No transfer** | One cannot have another's intention |
| **Individual responsibility** | Allah judges hearts, not appearances |

> Allah تعالى says: **﴿ وَأَن لَّيْسَ لِلْإِنسَانِ إِلَّا مَا سَعَىٰ ﴾** — *"Man receives only what he strives for"* [An-Najm: 39]

### 3️⃣ The Example of Hijrah (التمثيل بالهجرة)

The Prophet ﷺ gives a concrete example:

| **Hijrah for Dunya** | For worldly gain | ❌ No spiritual reward |
| **Hijrah for marriage** | For a woman to marry | ❌ No reward of Hijrah |

#### 📜 The Story of "Muhajir Umm Qays"

Among those who emigrated from Mecca to Medina, there was a man who emigrated not for Allah, but to marry a woman named **Umm Qays**.

The Companions رضي الله عنهم called him: **"مُهَاجِر أُمِّ قَيْس"** — The Muhajir of Umm Qays.

> This was not a sin (marriage is permissible), but he **lost the immense reward** of sincere Hijrah.
