## The Hadith

> **On the authority of the Commander of the Faithful, Abu Hafs Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say:**
>
> **"Actions are but by intentions, and every person will have only what they intended. So whoever's emigration was for Allah and His Messenger, then his emigration was for Allah and His Messenger. And whoever's emigration was for worldly gain or to marry a woman, then his emigration was for what he emigrated for."**
>
> — **[Al-Bukhari (1) and Muslim (1907)]**

## Introduction

This hadith is considered by scholars as **one of the most important in Islam**. Imam Al-Bukhari placed it first in his Sahih, and Imam Ahmad said: *"Islam rests upon three hadiths"*, mentioning this one first.

Imam Ash-Shafi'i (may Allah have mercy on him) said:

> *"This hadith represents one-third of knowledge, and it enters into seventy chapters of fiqh."*

## 1. Historical Context

### 1.1 The Occasion of this Hadith

This hadith was pronounced in the context of the **Hijrah** (emigration from Mecca to Medina). Among the Companions who emigrated, most did so sincerely for Allah and His Messenger.

However, there was a man who emigrated to marry a woman named **Umm Qays**. The Companions then called him *"the Muhajir of Umm Qays"* (مهاجر أم قيس).

### 1.2 The Lesson Drawn

The Prophet ﷺ used this occasion to establish a **universal rule**: the value of an act depends on the intention that motivates it.

## 3. Scholars' Explanations

### 3.1 Imam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him)

In his commentary on the 40 hadiths:

> *"This hadith is a great principle of Islam and one of its pillars. It alone constitutes a fundamental basis of the religion. Scholars are unanimous on its greatness and the abundance of its benefits."*

### 3.2 Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him)

In his book *Jami' Al-'Ulum wal-Hikam*:

> *"This hadith is the criterion for apparent actions, and the hadith 'Whoever innovates in our matter...' is the criterion for actions according to conformity to the Sunnah. Every act must therefore meet two conditions: sincerity and conformity."*

## 4. Lessons from the Hadith (الفوائد)

### 4.1 Intention is the condition for validity

Every act of worship requires an intention to be valid:

| Act | Without Intention | With Intention |
|-----|-------------------|----------------|
| Prayer | Meaningless movements | Accepted worship |
| Fasting | Simple abstention | Rewarded worship |
| Charity | Ordinary gift | Rewarded Sadaqa |
| Wudu | Body washing | Ritual purification |

### 4.2 Intention determines the reward

The same act can have different rewards depending on the intention:

| Act | Intention | Reward |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| Eating | Personal pleasure | None |
| Eating | Strengthening oneself to worship Allah | Reward |
| Sleeping | Rest | None |
| Sleeping | Resting to pray at night | Reward |
| Working | Earning money | No spiritual reward |
| Working | Providing for family for Allah's sake | Great reward |

## 6. Traps to Avoid

### 6.1 Showing Off (الرياء)

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **"What I fear most for you is the minor shirk."** They asked: "What is minor shirk?" He said: **"Showing off (الرياء)."**

- ✅ You post your acts of worship on social media
- ✅ You mention your good deeds in conversations

| Before praying | "Is this out of habit or love for Allah?" |
