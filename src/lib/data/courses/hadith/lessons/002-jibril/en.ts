## The Hadith

> **On the authority of Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: While we were sitting with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ one day, a man appeared before us with extremely white clothes and extremely black hair. No traces of travel could be seen on him, and none of us knew him.**
>
> **He sat down before the Prophet ﷺ, rested his knees against his knees, placed his palms on his thighs, and said: "O Muhammad, tell me about Islam."**
>
> **He ﷺ said: "Islam is to testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, to establish the prayer, to give zakat, to fast Ramadan, and to perform Hajj to the House if you are able to find a way."**
>
> **He said: "You have spoken the truth." We were amazed that he asked and then confirmed the answer!**
>
> **He said: "Tell me about Iman (faith)."**
>
> **He ﷺ said: "To believe in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day, and to believe in divine decree, both its good and evil."**
>
> **He said: "You have spoken the truth." He said: "Tell me about Ihsan (excellence)."**
>
> **He ﷺ said: "To worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you do not see Him, then indeed He sees you."**
>
> — **[Muslim (8)]**

## Introduction

This hadith is called **"the Mother of the Sunnah"** (أم السنة) by scholars because it summarizes the entire religion in three levels. Imam An-Nawawi said:

> *"This hadith gathers all the teachings of Islam, both apparent and hidden."*

---

## 1. The Three Levels of Religion

| Level | Arabic | Definition | Domain |
|-------|--------|------------|--------|
| **1. Islam** | الإسلام | External submission | Actions of the body |
| **2. Iman** | الإيمان | Internal faith | Beliefs of the heart |
| **3. Ihsan** | الإحسان | Excellence | State of the heart in worship |

### Relationship Between Them

- Every **Muhsin** is necessarily a Mu'min and Muslim
- Every **Mu'min** is necessarily a Muslim, but not necessarily a Muhsin
- Not every **Muslim** is a complete Mu'min

## 2. Islam: The Five Pillars

| Pillar | Arabic | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **1** | الشهادة | To testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger |
| **2** | الصلاة | To establish the five daily prayers |
| **3** | الزكاة | To give obligatory charity |
| **4** | الصيام | To fast the month of Ramadan |
| **5** | الحج | To perform pilgrimage if able |

### Modern Application

| Pillar | Current Challenge | Solution |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| Shahada | Internet doubts, atheism | Learn aqeedah, avoid pointless debates |
| Salat | Work, busy schedule | Plan, pray at work, make up |
| Zakat | Complex calculations | Use apps, consult scholars |
| Siyam | Long summer days | Know dispensations, make up |
| Hajj | High cost, visa issues | Save, plan ahead |

## 3. Iman: The Six Pillars of Faith

| Pillar | Arabic | What it implies |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **1** | الإيمان بالله | Believe in His existence, names, attributes, lordship, and divinity |
| **2** | الملائكة | Believe in angels as creatures of Allah made from light |
| **3** | الكتب | Believe in revealed Books (Torah, Gospel, Quran...) |
| **4** | الرسل | Believe in all prophets and messengers |
| **5** | اليوم الآخر | Believe in resurrection, judgment, paradise and hellfire |
| **6** | القدر | Believe in destiny, both its good and evil |

---

## 4. Ihsan: Excellence in Worship

### Definition

> **"To worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you do not see Him, then indeed He sees you."**

### The Two Levels of Ihsan

| Level | Description | State |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Mushahada** (المشاهدة) | Worship Allah as if you see Him | Love, longing, hope |
| **Muraqaba** (المراقبة) | Know that Allah sees you | Fear, vigilance |

### Modern Application

This concept applies especially when **no one sees you**:

| Situation | Without Ihsan | With Ihsan |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Alone on internet | Watch haram | Remember Allah sees |
| Alone at home | Skip prayer | Pray better than in public |
| At work unsupervised | Cheat, waste time | Work honestly |
| Traveling | "No one knows me" | "Allah knows me" |

## 5. Signs of the Hour

The complete hadith includes the question about the Hour. The Prophet ﷺ mentioned signs:

> *"When the slave-girl gives birth to her mistress, and when you see barefoot, naked shepherds competing in constructing tall buildings."*

| Sign | Interpretation | Today's Reality |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| Slave gives birth to master | Disrespect for parents | Children dictating to parents |
| Shepherds competing in buildings | Sudden wealth, materialism | Dubai, skyscrapers, luxury race |

---

## 6. Practical Lessons

### Self-Assessment: Where Am I?

| Question | Honest Answer |
|----------|---------------|
| Do I perform the 5 pillars? | Islam: YES / NO |
| Do I believe in the 6 pillars of faith? | Iman: YES / NO |
| Do I worship Allah as if He sees me? | Ihsan: YES / NO |

### Progression Plan

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **1** | Consolidate my Islam (5 pillars) |
| **2** | Strengthen my Iman (study aqeedah) |
| **3** | Aspire to Ihsan (constant muraqaba) |

---

## 7. Action Challenge

### Challenge of the Week

**Practice Muraqaba**: Awareness that Allah sees you.

| Moment | Reminder |
|--------|----------|
| Before opening your phone | "Allah sees what I will watch" |
| Before speaking/writing | "Allah hears every word" |
| Alone in your room | "I am never truly alone" |
| Facing temptation | "Would I choose this if I saw Allah?" |

---

| **Islam** | The 5 pillars | External acts |
| **Iman** | The 6 pillars of faith | Beliefs of the heart |
| **Ihsan** | Worship as if you see Allah | Constant awareness |
