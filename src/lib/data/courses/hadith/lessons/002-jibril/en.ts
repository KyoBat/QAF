### 🔷 Arabic Text with Full Diacritics

عَنْ **عُمَرَ بْنِ الْخَطَّابِ** رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ قَالَ:

بَيْنَمَا نَحْنُ جُلُوسٌ عِنْدَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ ﷺ ذَاتَ يَوْمٍ، إِذْ طَلَعَ عَلَيْنَا رَجُلٌ **شَدِيدُ بَيَاضِ الثِّيَابِ، شَدِيدُ سَوَادِ الشَّعَرِ**، لَا يُرَى عَلَيْهِ أَثَرُ السَّفَرِ، وَلَا يَعْرِفُهُ مِنَّا أَحَدٌ.

حَتَّى جَلَسَ إِلَى النَّبِيِّ ﷺ، **فَأَسْنَدَ رُكْبَتَيْهِ إِلَى رُكْبَتَيْهِ، وَوَضَعَ كَفَّيْهِ عَلَى فَخِذَيْهِ**.

وَقَالَ: **يَا مُحَمَّدُ أَخْبِرْنِي عَنِ الإِسْلَامِ؟**

فَقَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ ﷺ: **« الإِسْلَامُ أَنْ تَشْهَدَ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ اللَّهِ، وَتُقِيمَ الصَّلَاةَ، وَتُؤْتِيَ الزَّكَاةَ، وَتَصُومَ رَمَضَانَ، وَتَحُجَّ الْبَيْتَ إِنِ اسْتَطَعْتَ إِلَيْهِ سَبِيلًا. »**

قَالَ: صَدَقْتَ. فَعَجِبْنَا لَهُ يَسْأَلُهُ وَيُصَدِّقُهُ!

قَالَ: **فَأَخْبِرْنِي عَنِ الإِيمَانِ؟**

قَالَ: **« أَنْ تُؤْمِنَ بِاللَّهِ، وَمَلَائِكَتِهِ، وَكُتُبِهِ، وَرُسُلِهِ، وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ، وَتُؤْمِنَ بِالْقَدَرِ خَيْرِهِ وَشَرِّهِ. »**

قَالَ: صَدَقْتَ.

قَالَ: **فَأَخْبِرْنِي عَنِ الإِحْسَانِ؟**

قَالَ: **« أَنْ تَعْبُدَ اللَّهَ كَأَنَّكَ تَرَاهُ، فَإِنْ لَمْ تَكُنْ تَرَاهُ فَإِنَّهُ يَرَاكَ. »**

قَالَ: **فَأَخْبِرْنِي عَنِ السَّاعَةِ؟**

قَالَ: **« مَا الْمَسْئُولُ عَنْهَا بِأَعْلَمَ مِنَ السَّائِلِ. »**

قَالَ: **فَأَخْبِرْنِي عَنْ أَمَارَاتِهَا؟**

قَالَ: **« أَنْ تَلِدَ الْأَمَةُ رَبَّتَهَا، وَأَنْ تَرَى الْحُفَاةَ الْعُرَاةَ الْعَالَةَ رِعَاءَ الشَّاءِ يَتَطَاوَلُونَ فِي الْبُنْيَانِ. »**

ثُمَّ انْطَلَقَ، فَلَبِثْتُ مَلِيًّا، ثُمَّ قَالَ لِي: **« يَا عُمَرُ، أَتَدْرِي مَنِ السَّائِلُ؟ »**

قُلْتُ: اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَعْلَمُ.

قَالَ: **« فَإِنَّهُ جِبْرِيلُ أَتَاكُمْ يُعَلِّمُكُمْ دِينَكُمْ. »**

### 🔷 English Translation

**Umar ibn al-Khattab** (may Allah be pleased with him) reported:

While we were sitting with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ one day, a man appeared before us with **extremely white garments and extremely black hair**. No signs of travel were visible on him, and none of us recognized him.

He came and sat close to the Prophet ﷺ, **placing his knees against his knees and putting his hands on his thighs**.

He said: **"O Muhammad, tell me about Islam."**

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: **"Islam is to testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, to establish the prayer, to give zakat, to fast Ramadan, and to make pilgrimage to the House if you are able to do so."**

He said: "You have spoken the truth." We were amazed that he asked him and then confirmed his answer!

He said: **"Tell me about Iman (faith)."**

He ﷺ said: **"It is to believe in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day, and to believe in divine decree, both its good and its evil."**

He said: "You have spoken the truth."

He said: **"Tell me about Ihsan (excellence)."**

He ﷺ said: **"It is to worship Allah as though you see Him, and if you cannot see Him, then indeed He sees you."**

He said: **"Tell me about the Hour."**

He ﷺ said: **"The one asked about it knows no more than the one asking."**

He said: **"Then tell me about its signs."**

He ﷺ said: **"The slave woman will give birth to her mistress, and you will see barefoot, naked, destitute shepherds competing in constructing tall buildings."**

Then he departed. I stayed for a while, then he ﷺ said to me: **"O Umar, do you know who the questioner was?"**

I said: "Allah and His Messenger know best."

He ﷺ said: **"It was Jibril who came to teach you your religion."**
