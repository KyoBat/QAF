## 1. Introduction and Context

### A Comprehensive Guidance for Life

This great hadith constitutes a complete prophetic guidance that encompasses the three fundamental dimensions of a Muslim's life: their relationship with Allah, their relationship with themselves, and their relationship with others.

The Prophet ﷺ addressed these words to two of his most illustrious Companions, Abū Dharr and Mu'ādh رضي الله عنهما, transmitting to them a spiritual provision for life's journey.

This hadith is considered by scholars as one of the foundations of Islamic ethics, as it unites piety towards Allah (التقوى), repentance and rectification of faults (التوبة), and excellence in behavior with others (حسن الخلق).

| التقوى | at-taqwā | Pious fear, God-consciousness |
| حَيْثُمَا | ḥaythumā | Wherever, in any place |

## 5. In-Depth Explanation (Sharh)

### Imam An-Nawawi رحمه الله

An-Nawawi comments in Al-Arba'īn:

> "This hadith is of considerable importance. It contains essential recommendations and unites the rights of Allah and the rights of servants. The first recommendation concerns the relationship with Allah through Taqwa, the second concerns the relationship with oneself through repentance and rectification, and the third concerns the relationship with creation through good conduct."

> "The expression 'ḥaythumā kunta' (wherever you are) indicates that Taqwa must be maintained at all times, in all places, in public and in private."

### Imam Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali رحمه الله

In Jāmi' al-'Ulūm wal-Ḥikam, Ibn Rajab develops:

> "This hadith contains all the foundations of Islamic ethics. Taqwa is the foundation of all good, for whoever fears Allah does what He commands and leaves what He forbids, in secret as in public."

> "As for following up the bad deed with a good one, this includes sincere repentance (التوبة النصوح) and the good works that erase sins, like the five prayers, fasting Ramadan, and other acts of worship."

### Imam Al-Mubarakfuri رحمه الله

In Tuḥfat al-Aḥwadhī, he explains:

> "The statement 'khāliq an-nās bi khuluqin ḥasan' (treat people with good character) encompasses all social interactions: gentleness, forbearance, forgiveness, cheerfulness, kindness in words and deeds, helping others, and repelling harm with good."

### Imam Ibn al-Qayyim رحمه الله

In his works, Ibn al-Qayyim clarifies:

> "Taqwa is the spirit of religion and the secret of success in this world and the Hereafter. It is of two degrees: public Taqwa, which prevents apparent sins, and private Taqwa, which prevents hidden sins. The second is higher and more difficult."
