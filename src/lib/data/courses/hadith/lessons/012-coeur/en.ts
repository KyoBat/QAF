## 1. Introduction and Context

### The Importance of the Heart in Islam

This fundamental hadith establishes an essential principle of Islam: what truly matters in Allah's sight is not external appearance or material wealth, but the purity of the heart and the sincerity of one's deeds. This message corrects a superficial view of religion that would focus only on visible aspects.

The Prophet ﷺ pronounced this hadith to remind believers that the true value of an individual is not measured by their possessions, social status, or physical appearance, but by the state of their heart and the quality of their intentions.

This hadith is particularly relevant in our era where appearance and wealth are often overvalued, reminding us that divine criteria are fundamentally different from human criteria.

## 5. In-Depth Explanation (Sharh)

### Imam An-Nawawi رحمه الله

In his commentary on Sahih Muslim, An-Nawawi explains:

> "This hadith establishes that the criteria of value with Allah differ from those of people. People often judge based on appearance, beauty, wealth, and social status. But Allah only considers what is hidden: the purity of the heart, the sincerity of intention, and the conformity of the deed to His law."

> "The 'gaze' of Allah mentioned here is the gaze of consideration, acceptance, and reward, not the gaze of knowledge because Allah knows everything."

### Imam Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali رحمه الله

In Jāmi' al-'Ulūm wal-Ḥikam, Ibn Rajab develops:

> "Allah mentioned the heart before deeds because the heart is the king of the limbs. If it is sound, all deeds will be sound; if it is corrupt, all deeds will be corrupt. This is why the Prophet ﷺ said: 'Is it not that there is in the body a piece of flesh which, if it is sound, the whole body is sound, and if it is corrupt, the whole body is corrupt? Is it not that it is the heart?'"

### Imam Al-Qurtubi رحمه الله

Al-Qurtubi comments:

> "This hadith refutes those who take pride in their appearance or wealth. It also refutes those who despise the poor or people of modest appearance. True nobility is that of the heart, true wealth is that of piety."

### Imam Ibn al-Qayyim رحمه الله

In his works, Ibn al-Qayyim clarifies:

> "The heart is the true worshipper. The limbs are merely soldiers who execute the orders of the heart. When the heart is oriented toward Allah with sincerity and love, all limbs naturally follow. When the heart is sick or distracted, the deeds of the limbs become empty shells."
