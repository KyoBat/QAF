## 🔍 Linguistic Analysis

### 📜 Key Vocabulary

| Term | Transliteration | Meaning |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| **الدِّينُ** | ad-dīn | The religion |
| **النَّصِيحَةُ** | an-naṣīḥa | Sincere advice, loyalty |
| **للهِ** | lillāh | To Allah |
| **لِكِتَابِهِ** | li-kitābihi | To His Book |
| **لِرَسُولِهِ** | li-rasūlihi | To His Messenger |
| **لأَئِمَّةِ** | li-a'immati | To the leaders |
| **عَامَّتِهِمْ** | 'āmmatihim | Their common people, the masses |

### 📐 Grammatical Analysis

| Element | Analysis |
|---------|----------|
| **الدِّينُ** | Mubtada' (subject), nominative |
| **النَّصِيحَةُ** | Khabar (predicate), nominative |
| **للهِ** | Jārr wa-majrūr (preposition + complement) |

### 🔎 Linguistic Subtlety

The word **نَصِيحَة** comes from the root **ن-ص-ح** which means:

1. **To purify**: نَصَحَ العَسَلَ = to purify honey from impurities
2. **To be sincere**: Wanting pure good without mixture
3. **To sew firmly**: نَصَحَ الثَّوبَ = to sew a garment tightly

> Naṣīḥa is therefore: **pure sincerity without impurity**, which **consolidates** bonds like strong stitching.

**The structure "الدِّينُ النَّصِيحَةُ":**

This is an **exclusive nominal sentence** (جملة اسمية حصرية). It means:
> *"The religion IS NOTHING BUT sincere advice"* — it is its very essence.
