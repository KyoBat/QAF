## ⚡ The Miraculous Conversion

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 The Day He Wanted to Kill the Prophet ﷺ**

*One day, 'Umar took his sword and headed towards the Prophet ﷺ with the intention of **killing him**.*

*On the way, a man said to him:*

**A man:** "Start with your own family! Your sister Fāṭima and her husband Sa'īd have embraced Islam."

*Furious, 'Umar changed direction and headed to his sister's house.*

---

**At Fāṭima's House**

*As he approached, he heard a recitation of the Quran. He entered violently.*

**'Umar:** "What was that I heard?!"

*Fāṭima hid the parchment. 'Umar struck her so hard that blood flowed from her face.*

*Seeing the blood, something changed within him...*

**'Umar:** "Give me that parchment."

**Fāṭima:** "You are impure. Purify yourself first."

*'Umar purified himself, then read...*

</div>

What he read was the beginning of **Sūrah Ṭā-Hā**:

> **﴾ طه ۝ مَا أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْقُرْآنَ لِتَشْقَىٰ ۝ إِلَّا تَذْكِرَةً لِّمَن يَخْشَىٰ ﴿**
> "Ṭā-Hā. We have not sent down the Quran upon you to distress you, but only as a reminder for those who fear."
> — **[Sūrah Ṭā-Hā: 1-3]**

### The Transformation

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 At Dār al-Arqam — 'Umar's Conversion**

*'Umar, his heart transformed by the verses, said:*

**🟢 'Umar:** "**كَلَامٌ حَسَنٌ وَكَرِيمٌ! دُلُّونِي عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ** — What beautiful and noble speech! Take me to Muḥammad."

*He went to Dār al-Arqam where the Prophet ﷺ was teaching in secret. When he knocked at the door, the Companions were afraid. But Ḥamza said: "Let him enter."*

*The Prophet ﷺ seized him by the collar:*

**The Prophet ﷺ:** "What brings you here, son of al-Khaṭṭāb?"

**🟢 'Umar:** "**أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَأَنَّكَ رَسُولُ اللهِ**"

*The Muslims cried **"Allāhu Akbar"** so loudly that Mecca heard.*

</div>

## 🏆 His Accomplishments for Islam

### 1. The First to Pray Publicly

Before 'Umar, Muslims prayed **in secret**.

After his conversion, he said:

> "By Allah, we will worship Allah **publicly**!"

He gathered the Muslims and marched with them to the Ka'ba, Ḥamza at his side.

That day, the Quraysh saw that Islam had gained **strength**.

It was that day the Prophet ﷺ gave him the title of **al-Fārūq** — because his conversion marked the **distinction** between Islam's weakness and its strength.

---

### 2. The Just Conqueror

Under his caliphate, Islam spread **extraordinarily**:

| Conquest | Year |
|----------|------|
| **Syria** (Damascus, Jerusalem) | 15-16 AH |
| **Iraq** (Ctesiphon, Persian Empire) | 14-17 AH |
| **Egypt** ('Amr ibn al-'Āṣ) | 20 AH |
| **Persia** (entire empire) | 17-23 AH |

But what distinguished 'Umar was his **justice**:

> "When 'Umar entered Jerusalem, he refused to pray in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre for fear that Muslims would turn it into a mosque."

He entered the city **on foot**, holding the bridle of his camel on which his servant was riding — for they had been taking turns.

The Patriarch of Jerusalem said:

> "This is why you have conquered. Your kings walk on foot."

---

### 3. The Founder of the State

'Umar created the fundamental institutions of the Islamic caliphate:

| Institution | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **The Dīwān** | Register of soldiers and pensions |
| **The Hijri Calendar** | Beginning of the Islamic era |
| **The Provinces** | Administrative division with governors |
| **Bayt al-Māl** | Public treasury |
| **The Judiciary** | Separation of executive and judicial power |
| **The Police** | Maintaining order in cities |

---

### 4. The Servant of the People

'Umar patrolled **at night** through the streets of Medina, checking that no one was hungry.

One night, he found a woman with children who were crying. She was boiling water with stones to make them believe she was cooking.

'Umar **ran** to Bayt al-Māl, put a sack of flour on his back.

His servant said: *"Let me carry it, O Commander of the Believers."*

'Umar replied:

> **"أَأَنْتَ تَحْمِلُ وِزْرِي يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ؟"**
> "Will you carry my sins on the Day of Judgment?"

> — **The Prophet ﷺ** [Bukhārī]

## 😢 His Martyrdom

### The Assassination

<div class="scene-box">

**🗡️ The Prophet's Mosque — 26 Dhū al-Ḥijja 23 AH, Fajr Prayer**

*'Umar stood leading the Muslims in prayer. In the rows, a Persian slave named **Abū Lu'lu'a** crept forward...*

*Six stab wounds. 'Umar fell. He was carried to his home.*

---

*Before dying, he opened his eyes and asked:*

**🟢 'Umar:** "Who struck me?"

**Those present:** "Abū Lu'lu'a."

*'Umar's face relaxed and he said:*

**🟢 'Umar:** "**الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي لَمْ يَجْعَلْ مِيتَتِي بِيَدِ رَجُلٍ يَدَّعِي الْإِسْلَامَ** — Praise be to Allah who did not let my death be at the hand of a man claiming Islam."

</div>

### His Last Words

<div class="scene-box">

**💔 In 'Umar's Home — His Final Moments**

*'Umar looked at his son 'Abdullāh and said:*

**🟢 'Umar:** "Go to 'Ā'isha and ask her if I may be buried beside my Companion (the Prophet ﷺ) and Abū Bakr."

*'Abdullāh went to 'Ā'isha. She accepted, weeping:*

**'Ā'isha:** "I wanted that place for myself, but I give it to 'Umar."

## 💎 Key Lessons

### 1. No One Is Too Far from Guidance

Imagine: the man who set out to **kill** the Prophet ﷺ became the **greatest caliph** of Islam.

When you see someone far from Allah, remember 'Umar. **Guidance belongs to Allah alone.**

### 2. Strength Needs Direction

'Umar did not lose his strength by becoming Muslim — he **channeled it in the right direction**.

Strength is not a flaw. The flaw is using it against the truth.

### 3. Power Is Not Comfort

Caliph over half the known world — and yet:
- He wore **patched clothes**
- He ate **barley bread and dates**
- He patrolled **at night** to feed the poor himself

**True power is responsibility, not privilege.**

### 4. Justice Knows No Faces

He punished his own son for drinking alcohol. He dismissed governors who oppressed.

"If Fāṭima daughter of Muḥammad stole, I would cut off her hand."

**Justice has no exceptions.**

### 5. The Weight of Responsibility

"If a mule stumbles in Iraq, I fear that Allah will ask me: Why didn't you fix the road?"

Do we feel this weight regarding our responsibilities?
