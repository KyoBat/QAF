> **"If all the people took one valley and the Anṣār took another, I would take the valley of the Anṣār."**
>
> — **The Prophet ﷺ** [al-Bukhārī]

## 🎬 Introduction

The **Muhājirūn** left everything for Allah.

The **Anṣār** shared everything for Allah.

Without the Anṣār of Medina, Islam would have had **nowhere to go**.

This is the story of those who opened their homes, their hearts, and their lives.

---

## 🏙️ Who Are the Anṣār?

### Definition

**Anṣār** (الأنصار) means "the helpers" or "the supporters."

They are the inhabitants of **Medina** (then Yathrib) who:
1. Embraced Islam before the Hijra
2. Welcomed the Prophet ﷺ and the Muhājirūn
3. Shared their wealth with the emigrants

### The Two Tribes

| Tribe | Origin | Notable Leader |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Aws** | Yemeni | Sa'd ibn Mu'ādh |
| **Khazraj** | Yemeni | Sa'd ibn 'Ubāda |

These two tribes had been **enemies** for generations.

Islam **united** them.

## 💡 His Conversion

### Muṣ'ab ibn 'Umayr

Before the Hijra, the Prophet ﷺ sent **Muṣ'ab ibn 'Umayr** as the first ambassador to Medina.

Sa'd ibn Mu'ādh, respected chief of Aws, was **hostile** to this new religion.

<div class="scene-box">

**🌙 THE CHIEF'S CONVERSION**

*Sa'd ibn Mu'ādh, furious, goes to Muṣ'ab ibn 'Umayr...*

**🔴 Sa'd:** "What are you doing among us? Stop disturbing our people!"

**🟢 Muṣ'ab:** "Sit and listen. If you don't like it, I'll leave."

*Sa'd sat down, listened to the Quran, and his heart changed. He pronounced the shahāda on the spot.*

---

*He returns to his tribe:*

**🟢 Sa'd:** "O Banū 'Abd al-Ashhal! What do you think of me?"

**🔵 His tribe:** "You are our chief!"

**🟢 Sa'd:** "Then it is forbidden for me to speak to any of you until you believe in Allah and His Messenger!"

</div>

That day, **his entire tribe** entered Islam.

---

## ⚔️ The Judgment of Banū Qurayẓa

At the Battle of Khandaq (5 AH), Banū Qurayẓa betrayed their pact with the Muslims.

After the siege, they surrendered and requested an arbitrator.

The Prophet ﷺ accepted that Sa'd ibn Mu'ādh would judge.

Sa'd, wounded in the battle, was brought on a donkey.

### The Verdict

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 The Scene of Judgment**

**The Prophet ﷺ to the Anṣār:**
"Stand up to receive your chief!"

**To Banū Qurayẓa:**
"Have you accepted Sa'd's judgment?" — "Yes."

**To the Prophet ﷺ:**
"And you, O Messenger of Allah?" — "Yes."

**Sa'd:**
"My judgment is that the fighters be executed, the women and children captured, and the property distributed."

**The Prophet ﷺ:**
"You have judged according to Allah's judgment."

</div>

---

## 🌙 His Death and Divine Honor

Shortly after, Sa'd's wound opened and he died.

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **"The Throne of the Most Merciful trembled at the death of Sa'd ibn Mu'ādh."**

Jibrīl came to the Prophet ﷺ and said:

> "Who is this deceased for whom the gates of heaven have opened and for whom the Throne has trembled?"

<div class="scene-box">

**🍽️ The Generosity of Sa'd ibn 'Ubāda**

**📢 Every evening, a crier announced:**
"Whoever wants meat and fat, let him come to Sa'd ibn 'Ubāda!"

**🍽️** He fed 80 people or more every night

**💰** He regularly sent food to the Prophet ﷺ

</div>

---

## ⚔️ The Standard-Bearer

In every battle, Sa'd ibn 'Ubāda carried the standard of the Anṣār.

### The Day of Mecca's Conquest

Sa'd carried the standard and said:

> "Today is the day of slaughter! Today, the sacred will be violated!"

The Prophet ﷺ, fearing reprisals, took the standard from him and gave it to his son Qays.

Sa'd had a warm heart—sometimes too warm.

---

## 😢 Saqīfa: The Disagreement

After the Prophet's ﷺ death, the Anṣār gathered at **Saqīfa Banī Sā'ida**.

Sa'd ibn 'Ubāda was their candidate for the caliphate.

### The Anṣār's Argument

> "We welcomed the Prophet ﷺ. We fought for him. The caliphate belongs to us!"

### Abū Bakr's Response

Abū Bakr arrived with 'Umar and said:

> "The Arabs will only accept a Qurayshite. But we will not forget you—one leader from you, one from us."

'Umar intervened:

> "No! One leader only!"

Finally, Abū Bakr was elected.

### Sa'd's Position

Sa'd ibn 'Ubāda **refused** to pledge allegiance. He left to live in Syria.

He died there around 15 AH, having never pledged his oath.

---

# Part III: The Brotherhood (Mu'ākhāh) 🤝

## 📜 The Pact

Upon his arrival in Medina, the Prophet ﷺ established a unique system:

Each **Muhājir** was paired with an **Anṣārī**.

### The Rules

| Aspect | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Property** | Shared 50/50 |
| **Housing** | The Muhājir lives with the Anṣārī |
| **Inheritance** | The brother inherits (before the abrogating revelation) |

---

## 💎 The Example of 'Abd al-Raḥmān ibn 'Awf

### The Meeting

'Abd al-Raḥmān ibn 'Awf (Muhājir) was paired with **Sa'd ibn al-Rabī'** (Anṣārī).

Sa'd said:

> "I am the wealthiest of the Anṣār. I give you half my wealth. And I have two wives—choose the one you like, and I will divorce her for you."

'Abd al-Raḥmān replied:

> **"May Allah bless your family and your wealth. Just show me the way to the market."**

He went to the market, traded, and became one of the **wealthiest** men in Medina—through his own work.

---

## 🌟 The Generosity of the Anṣār

### The Verse of Their Praise

Allah said:

> **﴾ And they prefer [others] over themselves, even though they are in need ﴿**
> — **[al-Ḥashr: 9]**

### The Story of the Meal

An Anṣārī invited some Muhājirūn. He only had food for his children.

He and his wife **turned off the lamp** and pretended to eat so the guests could eat everything.

The next day, the Prophet ﷺ told them:

> "Allah laughed (with joy)—or was amazed—at what you did last night."

---

## 💎 Key Lessons

### 1. Hospitality Is Worship

The Anṣār welcomed **strangers** — people they knew only through Islam.

This became **their greatest merit**. Allah revealed about them: **"They give them preference over themselves."**

Are our homes open to those in need?

### 2. Sharing, Not Leftovers

Sa'd ibn al-Rabī' offered 'Abd al-Raḥmān:

> "I divide my wealth in two. And I divorce one of my wives for you to marry."

Not leftovers — **half!** This is true brotherhood.

### 3. Dignity in Receiving

'Abd al-Raḥmān refused and said: **"Direct me to the market."**

He preferred work over dependence. Giving is noble, **but dignity is nobler**.

### 4. Unity Before Tribe

Aws and Khazraj were **enemies** for decades.

Islam made them **one Ummah**. Religion is stronger than blood.
