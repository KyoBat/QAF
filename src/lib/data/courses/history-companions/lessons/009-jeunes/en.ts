## 🎬 Introduction

Among the Companions, some were merely **children** during the Prophet's ﷺ time.

Too young to fight at Badr. Too young for major decisions.

But they **observed**, **learned**, and **transmitted**.

Two of them became **beacons** for subsequent generations:

- **Ibn 'Abbās** — "The Ocean of Knowledge"
- **Ibn 'Umar** — "The Most Scrupulous of Men"

At 10 years old, he would bring water for the Prophet's ﷺ ablution.

One day, the Prophet ﷺ made this supplication for him:

> **"O Allah, give him understanding of the religion and teach him interpretation."**

This du'ā' shaped **his entire life**.

## 📖 The Quest for Knowledge

The Prophet ﷺ died when Ibn 'Abbās was about **13 years old**.

Problem: He hadn't been able to learn everything directly.

When asked why he humbled himself this way, he replied:

> "Today I am small and learning. Tomorrow I will be great and they will come to me."

## 🌊 The Ocean of Knowledge

### Expertise in Tafsīr

Ibn 'Abbās became **the greatest exegete** of the Quran among the Companions.

His method of interpretation:

| Level | Method |
|-------|--------|
| 1 | The Quran explains the Quran |
| 2 | The Sunnah explains the Quran |
| 3 | Sayings of the Companions |
| 4 | The Arabic language |
| 5 | Ijtihād (personal reasoning) |

### The Teacher of Teachers

His students became founders of tafsīr schools:

- **Mujāhid** — read the entire Quran with him, verse by verse
- **Sa'īd ibn Jubayr** — his most brilliant student
- **'Ikrima** — his servant who became a great scholar

---

## 💡 His Wisdom

### Advice to Ibn al-Zubayr

When Ibn al-Zubayr, young and impetuous, sought his counsel, Ibn 'Abbās said:

> "Knowledge is vast like an ocean. Take what you need and leave the rest."

### On Humility

> "I have learned from those smaller than me, and I have taught those greater than me."

---

## 👦 The Caliph's Son

### Too Young for Badr

At 14, Ibn 'Umar wanted to fight at Badr. The Prophet ﷺ turned him away:

> "You are too young."

At Uhud (15 years old), same refusal.

It was at **Khandaq** (17 years old) that he was finally accepted.

### In His Father's Shadow

Being 'Umar's son was not easy:

- 'Umar was **strict** with him
- He gave him **no privileges**
- He treated him like any other Muslim

When 'Umar distributed stipends, Ibn 'Umar received **less** than other Companions.

---

## 📿 The Meticulous Follower

Ibn 'Umar is famous for one thing: he **imitated the Prophet ﷺ in the smallest details**.

### Examples of His Scrupulousness

When asked why, he replied:

> "Who am I to choose differently from him ﷺ?"

## ⚖️ Refusal of Power

### Three Caliphates Refused

Ibn 'Umar was proposed for the caliphate **three times**:

1. After 'Uthmān — he refused
2. During the fitna — he remained neutral
3. After Mu'āwiya — he refused again

He would say:

> "I do not want a burden I will be questioned about on the Day of Judgment."

### Neutrality During the Fitna

During the civil war between 'Alī and Mu'āwiya, Ibn 'Umar:

- Did not fight for **either side**
- Did not criticize **either one**
- Prayed behind **whoever governed** his territory

His position: "I do not shed a Muslim's blood."

---

## 📚 His Juridical Legacy

Ibn 'Umar transmitted **~2,600 hadiths**.

### His Methodology

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Caution** | Preferred saying "I don't know" |
| **Literalism** | Followed the text without excessive interpretation |
| **Precaution** | Avoided the doubtful |

### His Influence

The scholars of Medina after him followed his methodology—notably Imam Mālik.

He died in Ṭā'if in 68 AH. His janāza was extraordinary.
