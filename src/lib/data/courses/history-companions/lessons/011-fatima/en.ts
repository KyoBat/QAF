She was called **"Umm Abīhā"** (mother of her father) for how much she cared for him.

## 💍 Marriage to 'Alī

### Rejected Suitors

Several prominent Companions asked for Fāṭima's hand:
- Abū Bakr — refused
- 'Umar — refused

The Prophet ﷺ would say: "I await Allah's command."

### 'Alī Comes Forward

'Alī, shy and poor, hesitated.

When he finally came, the Prophet ﷺ smiled:

> "I have kept a pearl for you."

### The Modest Dowry

'Alī only had his **armor**. He sold it for ~500 dirhams.

The Prophet ﷺ bought with that:
- A simple bed
- A pillow of palm fibers
- A water skin
- Some utensils

That was **all** they owned.

---

## 🏠 Simple Life

### Daily Work

Fāṭima did **everything** herself:
- Grinding grain (her hands bore the marks)
- Carrying water
- Sweeping
- Cooking

One day, she asked her father for a servant.

The Prophet ﷺ taught her **tasbīḥ** instead:

> **"Say 33 times Subḥān Allāh, 33 times al-Ḥamdu lillāh, 34 times Allāhu Akbar. That is better for you than a servant."**

---

## 🌟 Her Place with the Prophet ﷺ

### Special Welcome

When Fāṭima entered upon the Prophet ﷺ:

> He would **stand up**, kiss her forehead, and seat her **in his place**.

### The Resemblance

'Ā'isha said:

> "I never saw anyone more similar to the Prophet ﷺ in speech and manner of sitting than Fāṭima."

### The Final Secret

Before his death, the Prophet ﷺ called Fāṭima and whispered something to her.

She wept.

He whispered something else.

She laughed.

After his death, 'Ā'isha asked her what he had said:

1. **First whisper**: "I will die from this illness." → She wept.
2. **Second whisper**: "You will be the first of my family to join me, and you will be the mistress of the women of Paradise." → She laughed.

---

## 💀 Her Death

### The Six Months

Fāṭima **never recovered** from her father's death.

She remained in mourning for six months.

### The Final Request

She asked to be buried **at night**, to avoid the eyes of others.

'Alī honored her wish.

The Prophet ﷺ had spoken true: she was **the first** of his family to join him.

### The Central Hadith

> **"Al-Ḥasan and al-Ḥusayn are the masters of the youth of Paradise."**

---

## 📜 Al-Ḥasan: The Reconciler

### The Caliphate and Abdication

After 'Alī's assassination (40 AH), al-Ḥasan became caliph.

He had a large army facing Mu'āwiya.

But he saw that war would **destroy** the Ummah.

### The Decision

He **abdicated** in favor of Mu'āwiya, on conditions.

The Prophet ﷺ had predicted:

> **"This son of mine is a master, and perhaps Allah will reconcile through him two great groups of Muslims."**

The year of abdication was called **'Ām al-Jamā'a** (the Year of Unity).

---

## 💔 Al-Ḥusayn: The Martyr of Karbala

### The Context

After Mu'āwiya's death, his son Yazīd took power.

The people of Kūfa called to al-Ḥusayn: "Come! We will support you!"

### The Fatal Journey

Al-Ḥusayn departed with ~70 members of his family.

But at Karbala, Yazīd's army (thousands) surrounded them.

The Kūfīs had **abandoned** him.

### The 10th of Muḥarram 61 AH

Al-Ḥusayn and his companions were killed.

His head was sent to Yazīd.

This tragedy remains **a wound** in Islamic history.

## 💎 The Lessons

### 1. Love for Ahl al-Bayt

Loving the Prophet's ﷺ family is part of Islam—without excess or neglect.

### 2. Fāṭima's Simplicity

The Prophet's ﷺ daughter lived more simply than many ordinary Muslims.

### 3. Al-Ḥasan: Unity Before Ego

He gave up power to **preserve peace**.

### 4. Al-Ḥusayn: Firmness on Principles

He refused to pledge allegiance to what he considered unjust, even at the cost of his life.

---

## ⚖️ The Balance

Sunni Islam teaches:

1. **Love** Ahl al-Bayt sincerely
2. **Do not** deify them or attribute infallibility to them
3. **Also love** the Companions, including Abū Bakr and 'Umar
4. **Do not** use Ahl al-Bayt to divide the Ummah
