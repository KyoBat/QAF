## 🌅 Before Marriage: The Queen of Mecca

### An Exceptional Woman

Khadīja was a **unique woman** in the Arabia of her time:

- **Wealthy** — the greatest merchant woman of Quraysh
- **Respected** — nicknamed "al-Ṭāhira" (the Pure) even before Islam
- **Independent** — widowed twice, she managed her commercial empire alone
- **Sought after** — the noblest of Quraysh asked for her hand; she refused

### The Encounter

Khadīja was looking for a **trustworthy** man to manage a caravan to Syria. She was recommended **Muḥammad**, known for his integrity.

She sent her servant **Maysara** to observe this 25-year-old young man.

Maysara returned amazed:

> "I have never seen such a man. The profits doubled. And I saw strange signs — a cloud protected him from the sun."

### The Marriage Proposal

It was **Khadīja** who proposed marriage — through her friend Nafīsa.

Muḥammad ﷺ accepted. The marriage was celebrated.

## 🏆 Her Role in Islam

### 1. The First Believer

When the Prophet ﷺ came down trembling from the cave of Ḥirā' after the first revelation, it was **Khadīja** who reassured him:

> **"كَلَّا وَاللهِ، لَا يُخْزِيكَ اللهُ أَبَدًا، إِنَّكَ لَتَصِلُ الرَّحِمَ، وَتَحْمِلُ الْكَلَّ، وَتَكْسِبُ الْمَعْدُومَ، وَتَقْرِي الضَّيْفَ، وَتُعِينُ عَلَى نَوَائِبِ الْحَقِّ"**
> "No! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you. You maintain family ties, you bear the burdens of others, you give to those who have nothing, you honor the guest, and you help in the trials of truth."

She believed **immediately** — the **first person** in humanity to embrace Islam.

### 2. Unwavering Support

During **25 years** of marriage, Khadīja was:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Loving wife** | She surrounded him with love and tenderness |
| **Advisor** | She guided him in moments of doubt |
| **Financial backer** | She put all her fortune at the service of Islam |
| **Protector** | She protected him from Quraysh's persecutions |

### 3. Greetings from Allah

Allah Himself sent His **greetings** to Khadīja through Jibrīl:

> **"يَا رَسُولَ اللهِ، هَذِهِ خَدِيجَةُ قَدْ أَتَتْكَ، فَاقْرَأْ عَلَيْهَا السَّلَامَ مِنْ رَبِّهَا وَمِنِّي، وَبَشِّرْهَا بِبَيْتٍ فِي الْجَنَّةِ مِنْ قَصَبٍ، لَا صَخَبَ فِيهِ وَلَا نَصَبَ"**
> "O Messenger of Allah, here is Khadīja coming to you. Convey to her the greetings from her Lord and from me, and give her the glad tidings of a house in Paradise made of hollow pearls, with no noise nor fatigue in it."
> — **Bukhārī**

---

## 😢 The Year of Sorrow

In 619 CE, Khadīja died. The same year, Abū Ṭālib (the protective uncle) also died.

The Prophet ﷺ called this year **"The Year of Sorrow"** (عام الحزن).

He **never** forgot her. Years later, he would still mention:

> "She believed in me when people rejected me. She gave me her wealth when people deprived me. And Allah gave me children through her while He did not give me from other women."

## 😢 The Trial of the Slander (al-Ifk)

One of 'Ā'isha's greatest trials was the slanderous accusation:

During an expedition, she had gone away to look for her necklace. The army left without her. **Ṣafwān ibn al-Mu'aṭṭal** found her and brought her back.

Hypocrites spread **horrible rumors**.

'Ā'isha, innocent, wept for days. The Prophet ﷺ himself did not know what to say.

Then Allah revealed her **innocence** from above the seven heavens:

> **﴾ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ جَاءُوا بِالْإِفْكِ عُصْبَةٌ مِّنكُمْ ۚ لَا تَحْسَبُوهُ شَرًّا لَّكُم ۖ بَلْ هُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ ﴿**
> "Those who brought forth the slander are a group among you. Do not think it is bad for you; rather it is good for you."
> — **[Sūrah Al-Nūr: 11]**

## 💎 Key Lessons

### 1. Support at the Decisive Moment (Khadīja)

When the Revelation came, the Prophet ﷺ was frightened. He said: **"Cover me! Cover me!"**

Khadīja didn't say: "What's wrong with you?" She said: "No! By Allah, He will never disgrace you."

When everyone doubts, the support of **one person** can change everything.

### 2. Knowledge Is a Right for Women ('Ā'isha)

**2,210 hadiths.** The greatest scholars among the Companions consulted her.

Islam encourages women to **learn and teach**. 'Ā'isha is the living proof.

### 3. Love Expressed Openly

The Prophet ﷺ didn't hide his love for his wives:
- "I was granted love for her" (about Khadīja)
- "The person I love most" (about 'Ā'isha)

**Model for spouses**: love is expressed, not hidden.

### 4. Loyalty After Death

Years after Khadīja's death, the Prophet ﷺ still mentioned her kindly and maintained ties with her friends.

**Loyalty doesn't die with loved ones.**
