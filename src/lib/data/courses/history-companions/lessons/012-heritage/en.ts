## 📖 2. Knowledge as Priority

### The Model of Ibn 'Abbās

He slept **at the doorsteps** of Companions to learn.

### Practical Application

| His Example | Your Application |
|-------------|------------------|
| Actively seeking knowledge | Taking courses, reading, asking |
| Verifying sources | Not believing everything circulated |
| Teaching others | Sharing what you learn |

---

## 🤝 3. Unity of the Ummah

### The Model of al-Ḥasan

He **abdicated** to avoid civil war.

> "The unity of the Ummah is worth more than my personal power."

### Questions to Ask Yourself

- Am I dividing or uniting?
- Do my words create fitna?
- Am I willing to give up "being right" for peace?

---

## 💰 4. Generosity Without Limits

### The Model of 'Uthmān

He bought the well of Rūma for **all** Muslims—free of charge.

### The Model of the Anṣār

> **﴾ And they prefer [others] over themselves, even though they are in need ﴿**

## 🔄 5. The Capacity to Change

### The Model of 'Umar and Khālid

Two men who fought **against** Islam.

Then they became its **greatest defenders**.

### The Lesson

- The past does not define the future
- Islam erases what came before

# Part III: The Companions and Us 🪞

## 🤔 Questions for Reflection

### About Abū Bakr

> Am I the **first** to respond when Islam needs me?
> Or do I wait for others to act?

### About 'Umar

> Am I capable of recognizing my **mistakes** and changing?
> Or does my ego block me?

### About 'Uthmān

> Is my generosity **visible** to impress?
> Or **secret** to please Allah alone?

### About 'Alī

> Do I seek **knowledge** as much as I seek comfort?
> Do I transmit what I learn?

### About the Oppressed

> In my small daily trials, do I have their **patience**?

### About the Anṣār

> Do I truly **welcome** others?
> Or do I stay in my comfort zone?

---

## 💎 The Final Summary

### What They Left Us

1. **The Quran** — preserved through their memorization
2. **The Sunnah** — transmitted through their narrations
3. **Example** — how to live Islam concretely
4. **Unity** — they built an Ummah, not sects
5. **Hope** — ordinary humans can do the extraordinary
