## 🎬 Introduction

In the first years of Islam, the **most persecuted** were not the nobles of Quraysh—they had tribal protection.

The most tortured were **slaves** and **foreigners**: those with no one to defend them.

Yet they are the ones who **shine brightest** in Islamic history.

## 😢 The Torture

Bilāl was the slave of **Umayya ibn Khalaf**, one of Islam's fiercest enemies.

When Umayya discovered his slave had embraced Islam, he decided to **break him**.

### The Torment

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 Scene of Torture**

**• Time:** Midday, the sun at its zenith
**• Place:** The burning rocks of Mecca's desert

Umayya would drag Bilāl, strip off his clothes, and throw him on the scorching rocks.

Then place a **massive boulder** on his chest.

**Umayya:** "You will stay like this until you die or renounce Muḥammad!"

Bilāl, gasping under the weight, repeating:

**"Aḥad... Aḥad..."**
*(One... One...)*

</div>

This word — **Aḥad** — became the symbol of resistance for the oppressed.

## 🏆 Liberation

One day, **Abū Bakr** passed by and saw Bilāl being tortured.

He asked Umayya: "How much for this slave?"

Umayya, with contempt: "Take him for whatever you want, he's worthless."

Abū Bakr paid a huge sum and **freed** Bilāl immediately.

When Abū Bakr was told he paid too much, he replied:

> "If he had asked for a hundred times more, I would have paid it."

## 🌟 His Glory

### First Muezzin

In Medina, the Prophet ﷺ sought a way to call people to prayer.

After 'Abd Allāh ibn Zayd's vision about the adhān, the Prophet ﷺ said:

> **"Rise, O Bilāl, and call to prayer!"**

His beautiful voice rang out **for the first time** across Medina's sky.

### The Conquest of Mecca

On the day of Mecca's conquest, the Prophet ﷺ ordered Bilāl to climb **the Ka'ba** and give the call to prayer.

The former tortured slave now calling to prayer from **the roof of Quraysh's sanctuary**.

Divine vindication.

## 💪 His Story

When Ṣuhayb wanted to emigrate to Medina, Quraysh stopped him:

> "You came to us poor and became rich among us. Do you think you'll leave with your wealth?"

Ṣuhayb offered:

> **"What if I leave you all my wealth? Will you let me go?"**

They accepted. He showed them where **all his fortune** was hidden and left for Medina **with nothing**.

When he arrived, the Prophet ﷺ welcomed him joyfully:

> **"The trade was profitable, O Abū Yaḥyā! The trade was profitable!"**

Allah revealed about him:

> **﴾ And among people is he who sells himself seeking the pleasure of Allah ﴿**

## 😢 The Martyred Family

'Ammār's family—his father **Yāsir**, his mother **Sumayya**, and he himself—were the **most tortured** family.

### Collective Torture

Abū Jahl would torture them personally, under the scorching sun:

- **Yāsir** — beaten until exhaustion
- **Sumayya** — elderly woman, bound and beaten
- **'Ammār** — branded with fire, drowned in water

The Prophet ﷺ would pass by them, unable to physically rescue them. He would say:

> **"Patience, O family of Yāsir! Your meeting place is Paradise!"**

### The First Martyrs

**Sumayya** refused to renounce Islam. Abū Jahl, enraged, took a spear and **stabbed her**.

She became **the first martyr in Islam**.

Shortly after, **Yāsir** also died under torture.

### Under Duress

'Ammār, exhausted beyond endurance, uttered words of disbelief **under compulsion**.

Devastated, he came to the Prophet ﷺ weeping:

> "O Messenger of Allah, they did not leave me until I insulted you and praised their gods!"

The Prophet ﷺ asked:

> "How do you find your heart?"

> "Firm in faith."

The Prophet ﷺ smiled:

> **"If they do it again, do the same."**

And Allah revealed:

> **﴾ Except for one who is compelled while his heart is secure in faith ﴿**
> — **[al-Naḥl: 106]**

---

## 🏆 The Prophecy

The Prophet ﷺ told 'Ammār:

> **"You will be killed by the transgressing group."**

At Ṣiffīn (37 AH), 'Ammār, advanced in age, fought alongside 'Alī. He was killed.

The prophecy was fulfilled.

## 💎 Key Lessons

### 1. Apparent Weakness Hides Real Strength

Slaves and foreigners were considered **the weakest** in Quraysh's eyes.

But their faith was **the strongest**. Bilāl under the rocks: "Aḥad, aḥad." He didn't break.

The lesson: **don't judge anyone by their appearance.**

### 2. Wealth Is a Test

Ṣuhayb gave up **all his fortune** to Quraysh in exchange for his departure.

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"The trade was profitable!"**

Question for us: what do we give up for our religion? **Or nothing at all?**

### 3. Duress Is Excused

'Ammār insulted Islam under torture. He came to the Prophet ﷺ weeping.

The Prophet: **"How do you find your heart?"** He said: "At peace in faith."

Allah revealed: **"Except for one who is compelled while his heart is at peace in faith."**

### 4. Paradise for the Persecuted

The Prophet ﷺ could not save Yāsir's family from torture.

But he promised them: **"Patience, family of Yāsir! Your appointment is Paradise."**

Suffering has an end. **Paradise has no end.**
