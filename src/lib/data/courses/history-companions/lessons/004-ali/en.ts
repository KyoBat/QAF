## 🌅 Childhood in the Prophet's ﷺ House

### Raised by the Prophet ﷺ

'Alī was not just the Prophet's ﷺ cousin — he was **raised** in his house.

When 'Alī was about **6 years old**, a famine struck Quraysh. The Prophet ﷺ, though he had not yet received revelation, offered to his uncle Abū Ṭālib ('Alī's father):

> "Let me take 'Alī to my home to lighten your burden."

Thus, 'Alī grew up under the **roof** and **direct education** of the Prophet ﷺ.

### The First Muslim Child

When revelation came, 'Alī was about **10 years old**.

One day, he found the Prophet ﷺ and Khadīja praying.

## 🏆 His Accomplishments for Islam

### 1. The Night of Sacrifice

When the Quraysh decided to kill the Prophet ﷺ, Allah informed him and ordered him to emigrate.

But the assassins were surrounding his house.

The Prophet ﷺ asked 'Alī:

> "Sleep in my bed tonight."

**'Alī accepted without hesitation** — knowing the assassins might kill him.

He slept, covered by the Prophet's ﷺ green cloak.

The assassins waited all night. At dawn, when they discovered it was 'Alī, the Prophet ﷺ was already far away.

Allah revealed:

> **﴾ وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَشْرِي نَفْسَهُ ابْتِغَاءَ مَرْضَاتِ اللَّهِ ﴿**
> "And among the people is he who sells himself seeking the pleasure of Allah."
> — **[Sūrah Al-Baqara: 207]**

---

### 2. The Hero of Badr and Khaybar

'Alī was a **legendary warrior**. At Badr, he killed several champions of Quraysh.

But it was at **Khaybar** that his legend reached its peak.

The Prophet ﷺ had besieged the fortress for days. At night, he announced:

> **"لَأُعْطِيَنَّ الرَّايَةَ غَدًا رَجُلًا يُحِبُّ اللهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَيُحِبُّهُ اللهُ وَرَسُولُهُ"**
> "Tomorrow, I will give the banner to a man who loves Allah and His Messenger, and whom Allah and His Messenger love."

Every Companion hoped to be that man. In the morning, the Prophet ﷺ called:

— **"Where is 'Alī?"**
— *"He is suffering from his eyes, O Messenger of Allah."*

'Alī was brought, his eyes painful. The Prophet ﷺ **spat** in his eyes — and they were instantly healed.

Then 'Alī marched toward the fortress. He **tore** the gate from its hinges — a gate that several men could not move — and used it as a shield.

The fortress fell.

### 3. Marriage to Fāṭima

Among all the suitors for Fāṭima's hand, it was **'Alī** whom the Prophet ﷺ chose.

Their marriage was **simple**:

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Dowry** | 'Alī's armor (400 dirhams) |
| **Bed** | A sheepskin |
| **Food** | Dates and water |

But from this union were born **al-Ḥasan** and **al-Ḥusayn** — the two masters of the youth of Paradise, and the **descendants** of the Prophet ﷺ.

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **"فَاطِمَةُ بَضْعَةٌ مِنِّي، مَنْ أَغْضَبَهَا أَغْضَبَنِي"**
> "Fāṭima is a part of me. Whoever angers her angers me."

### 4. The Scholar Par Excellence

'Alī was known for his **profound knowledge**:

| Field | His Mastery |
|-------|-------------|
| **Quran** | He knew the time and context of every revelation |
| **Fiqh** | The Companions consulted him for complex questions |
| **Arabic Language** | He established the foundations of Arabic grammar |
| **Eloquence** | His sermons are masterpieces (Nahj al-Balāgha) |
| **Justice** | 'Umar said: "Without 'Alī, 'Umar would have perished" |

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **"أَقْضَاكُمْ عَلِيٌّ"**
> "The best of you in judgment is 'Alī."

## 😢 His Caliphate and Martyrdom

### A Difficult Caliphate

'Alī became caliph after the assassination of 'Uthmān, during a period of **fitna** (discord).

He had to face:

| Trial | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Battle of the Camel** | Against 'Ā'isha, Ṭalḥa, and al-Zubayr (by misunderstanding) |
| **Battle of Ṣiffīn** | Against Mu'āwiya |
| **The Khārijites** | Those who turned against him |

Despite these trials, 'Alī remained **just** and **merciful** toward his adversaries.

### The Assassination

On 17 Ramaḍān 40 AH, as he was going to the Fajr prayer, a Khārijite named **'Abd al-Raḥmān ibn Muljam** struck him on the head with a poisoned sword.

'Alī said:

> **"فُزْتُ وَرَبِّ الْكَعْبَةِ"**
> "I have succeeded, by the Lord of the Ka'ba!"

He died two days later, at **63 years old** — the same age as the Prophet ﷺ.

His last instructions:

> "Treat my assassin well. If I survive, it is my right (to forgive or not). If I die before him, do not mutilate his body."

## 🔗 His Relationship with the Prophet ﷺ

### The Hadith of Manzila

During the expedition of Tabūk, the Prophet ﷺ left 'Alī in Medina to manage affairs.

'Alī said:

— *"Are you leaving me behind with the women and children?"*

The Prophet ﷺ replied:

> **"أَمَا تَرْضَى أَنْ تَكُونَ مِنِّي بِمَنْزِلَةِ هَارُونَ مِنْ مُوسَى، إِلَّا أَنَّهُ لَا نَبِيَّ بَعْدِي"**
> "Are you not satisfied to be to me as Hārūn was to Mūsā, except that there is no prophet after me?"

### Abū Turāb — The Father of Dust

One day, the Prophet ﷺ found 'Alī sleeping in the mosque, covered with dust. He said affectionately:

> **"قُمْ أَبَا تُرَابٍ"**
> "Get up, Abū Turāb (father of dust)!"

This nickname became a **title of honor** that 'Alī loved.
