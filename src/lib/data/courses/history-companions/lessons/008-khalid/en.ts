## 🎬 Introduction

He is **the greatest general** in Islamic history—and perhaps in world military history.

He fought **against** Islam at Uhud, then fought **for** Islam from his conversion until his death.

He **never lost a single battle**.

Not under Quraysh. Not under the Prophet ﷺ. Not under Abū Bakr. Not under 'Umar.

This is the story of **Khālid ibn al-Walīd**, the Sword of Allah.

## ⚔️ Against Islam

### Uhud: The Defeat of the Muslims

At the Battle of Uhud (3 AH), the Muslims had the advantage.

The Prophet ﷺ had stationed **50 archers** on Mount 'Aynān with the order:

> "Do not move, whether we win or lose!"

When the Muslims appeared victorious, **40 archers** left their posts to collect spoils.

Khālid, commander of the Quraysh cavalry, saw the opening.

He circled around the mountain and **charged from behind**.

\`\`\`

That day, **70 Muslims** died, including the Prophet's ﷺ uncle, Ḥamza.

The battle was lost due to disobedience—and Khālid's military genius.

---

## 🤔 The Conversion

After the Treaty of Ḥudaybiyya, the Prophet ﷺ sent a message:

> **"Someone like Khālid, if he put his intelligence in service of Islam..."**

These words reached Khālid. He reflected.

He saw Islam growing, Quraysh weakening.

But more than that, he felt **the truth**.

### The Journey

He departed for Medina with 'Amr ibn al-'Āṣ (another future general) and 'Uthmān ibn Ṭalḥa.

When they arrived, the Prophet ﷺ smiled:

> **"Mecca has given us its liver."**
> *(its best men)*

Khālid pronounced the shahāda and said:

> "O Messenger of Allah, ask Allah to forgive my past hostility."

The Prophet ﷺ replied:

> **"Islam erases what came before."**

# Part II: The Drawn Sword ⚔️

## 🏆 Mu'ta: The Nickname

Three months after his conversion, Khālid participated in the **Battle of Mu'ta** (8 AH).

A Muslim army of **3,000** men faced a Byzantine army of **200,000**.

### The Catastrophe

The three designated commanders were killed successively:

1. **Zayd ibn Ḥāritha** — killed
2. **Ja'far ibn Abī Ṭālib** — killed ('Alī's brother)
3. **'Abd Allāh ibn Rawāḥa** — killed

The army was leaderless, facing a force 70 times their size.

### Khālid's Miracle

Khālid took command without being appointed.

In **one night**, he reorganized the army:

Khālid broke **9 swords** that day.

When the survivors returned to Medina, some jeered: "Deserters!"

The Prophet ﷺ stopped them:

> **"No! They are kurrār (those who return to fight), not furrār (deserters)!"**

And he gave Khālid his eternal nickname:

> **"سَيْفُ اللهِ الْمَسْلُول"**
> **The Drawn Sword of Allah**

## 📊 Conquests Under Abū Bakr

After the Prophet's ﷺ death, Abū Bakr charged Khālid with two missions:

### 1. The Wars of Apostasy (Riddah)

Several tribes had left Islam.

Khālid subdued them one by one with **terrifying efficiency**.

The Battle of Yamāma against Musaylama the false prophet was particularly bloody—but Khālid triumphed.

### 2. The Conquest of Iraq

Khālid conquered Persian Mesopotamia in legendary battles:

| Battle | Date | Opponent | Result |
|--------|------|----------|--------|
| Chains | 12 AH | Persians | Victory |
| Ullays | 12 AH | Persians | Victory |
| Walaja | 12 AH | Persians | Victory |
| Ḥīra | 12 AH | Persians | Victory |

## 🏜️ The Desert March

In 13 AH, Abū Bakr needed Khālid **in Syria** against the Byzantines.

Problem: Khālid was **in Iraq**, weeks of marching away.

### The Impossible

Khālid decided to cross the **Syrian Desert**—a route deemed impossible.

In **6 days**, the Byzantine army was annihilated.

The Byzantine Empire lost Syria, Palestine, and Egypt.

**One man** had changed the map of the world.

# Part III: Disgrace and Death 💔

## 😢 Dismissed by 'Umar

In the middle of the Battle of Yarmouk, 'Umar became caliph (Abū Bakr had just died).

His first decision: **dismiss Khālid**.

Why? Several reasons:

1. **Excesses** — Khālid had sometimes exceeded orders
2. **Popularity** — 'Umar feared people would attribute victories to Khālid, not Allah
3. **Pride** — Khālid had a certain ego

Khālid accepted without protest:

> "I hear and obey the Commander of the Believers."

He then served as an **ordinary soldier** under Abū 'Ubayda.

---

## 💀 Death in His Bed

Khālid died in Homs in 21 AH—**in his bed**.

His last words were bitter:

> "I have fought in a hundred battles or so. There is not a spot on my body the size of a hand without a scar from a sword or spear. And here I am dying in my bed like a camel dies! May the eyes of cowards never sleep!"

He had dreamed of dying a **shahīd** (martyr) on the battlefield.

Allah had decided otherwise.

---

## 💎 Lessons from His Life

### 1. Sincere Conversion Erases Everything

Khālid had killed Muslims at Uhud. Islam erased all of that.

### 2. Genius is an Amāna

His military talent was a **trust** (amāna) from Allah, which he used for Islam.

### 3. Obedience Above Ego

When 'Umar dismissed him, Khālid could have rebelled. He obeyed.

### 4. Death is in Allah's Hands

The Sword of Allah did not die on the battlefield. Allah decides.
