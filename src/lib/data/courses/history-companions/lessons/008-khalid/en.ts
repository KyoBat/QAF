## 📖 Introduction

He is **the greatest general** in Islamic history—and perhaps in world military history.

He fought **against** Islam at Uhud, then fought **for** Islam from his conversion until his death.

He **never lost a single battle**.

Not under Quraysh. Not under the Prophet ﷺ. Not under Abū Bakr. Not under 'Umar.

This is the story of **Khālid ibn al-Walīd**, the Sword of Allah.

## ⚔️ Against Islam

### Uhud: The Defeat of the Muslims

At the Battle of Uhud (3 AH), the Muslims had the advantage.

The Prophet ﷺ had stationed **50 archers** on Mount 'Aynān with the order:

> "Do not move, whether we win or lose!"

When the Muslims appeared victorious, **40 archers** left their posts to collect spoils.

Khālid, commander of the Quraysh cavalry, saw the opening.

He circled around the mountain and **charged from behind**.

**⚔️ Battle of Uhud — Khālid's Maneuver**

| Phase | What Happened |
|-------|---------------|
| **1. Position** | 50 archers on Mount 'Aynān 🏝️ |
| **2. Order** | "Do not move, win or lose!" |
| **3. Error** | 40 archers leave for spoils 💰 |
| **4. Breach** | Only 10 archers remain ⚠️ |
| **5. Genius** | Khālid sees the opportunity 👁️ |
| **6. Maneuver** | Circles around with cavalry 🐎 |
| **7. Attack** | Strikes Muslim army from behind ⚔️ |

**😢 Result:**
- Muslim defeat
- 70 Companions martyred
- The Prophet ﷺ injured

</div>

The battle was lost due to disobedience—and Khālid's military genius.

## 🤔 The Conversion

After the Treaty of Ḥudaybiyya, the Prophet ﷺ sent a message:

> **"Someone like Khālid, if he put his intelligence in service of Islam..."**

These words reached Khālid. He reflected.

He saw Islam growing, Quraysh weakening.

But more than that, he felt **the truth**.

### The Journey

He departed for Medina with 'Amr ibn al-'Āṣ (another future general) and 'Uthmān ibn Ṭalḥa.

<div class="scene-box">

**🌙 THE SWORD'S CONVERSION**

*Khālid ibn al-Walīd arrives in Medina with his travel companions...*

*The Prophet ﷺ welcomes them with a smile:*

**🟢 The Prophet ﷺ:** **"Mecca has given us its liver."** *(its best men)*

*Khālid pronounces the shahāda, then humbly asks:*

**🔵 Khālid:** "O Messenger of Allah, ask Allah to forgive my past hostility."

**🟢 The Prophet ﷺ:** **"Islam erases what came before."**

</div>

# Part II: The Drawn Sword ⚔️

## 🏆 Mu'ta: The Nickname

Three months after his conversion, Khālid participated in the **Battle of Mu'ta** (8 AH).

A Muslim army of **3,000** men faced a Byzantine army of **200,000**.

### The Catastrophe

The three designated commanders were killed successively:

1. **Zayd ibn Ḥāritha** — killed
2. **Ja'far ibn Abī Ṭālib** — killed ('Alī's brother)
3. **'Abd Allāh ibn Rawāḥa** — killed

The army was leaderless, facing a force 70 times their size.

### Khālid's Miracle

Khālid took command without being appointed.

In **one night**, he reorganized the army:

<div class="scene-box">

**🧠 Khālid's Strategy at Mu'ta**

**🌙 Night:**
- Exchange positions (right wing ↔ left wing)
- Send a detachment to make noise from behind

**🌅 Dawn:**
- The Byzantines see "new" fresh troops
- They hear reinforcements arriving from behind
- They think it's a TRAP...

**📊 Result:**

| Army | Size |
|------|------|
| Muslims | 3,000 |
| Byzantines | 200,000 |
| **Survivors** | **3,000 ✓** |

*The Byzantines hesitate, Khālid organizes an orderly retreat!*

</div>

Khālid broke **9 swords** that day. ⚔️

<div class="scene-box">

**⚔️ THE SWORD OF ALLAH**

*The survivors of Mu'ta return to Medina. Some jeer at them:*

**🔴 Some Medinans:** "Deserters!"

*The Prophet ﷺ intervenes and defends them:*

**🟢 The Prophet ﷺ:** **"No! They are kurrār (those who return to fight), not furrār (deserters)!"**

*Then he gives Khālid his eternal nickname:*

**🟢 The Prophet ﷺ:** **"سَيْفُ اللهِ الْمَسْلول"** — *The Drawn Sword of Allah*

</div>

## 📊 Conquests Under Abū Bakr

After the Prophet's ﷺ death, Abū Bakr charged Khālid with two missions:

### 1. The Wars of Apostasy (Riddah)

Several tribes had left Islam.

Khālid subdued them one by one with **terrifying efficiency**.

The Battle of Yamāma against Musaylama the false prophet was particularly bloody—but Khālid triumphed.

### 2. The Conquest of Iraq

Khālid conquered Persian Mesopotamia in legendary battles:

| Battle | Date | Opponent | Result |
|--------|------|----------|--------|
| Chains | 12 AH | Persians | Victory |
| Ullays | 12 AH | Persians | Victory |
| Walaja | 12 AH | Persians | Victory |
| Ḥīra | 12 AH | Persians | Victory |

## 🏜️ The Desert March

In 13 AH, Abū Bakr needed Khālid **in Syria** against the Byzantines.

Problem: Khālid was **in Iraq**, weeks of marching away.

### The Impossible

Khālid decided to cross the **Syrian Desert**—a route deemed impossible.

<div class="scene-box">

**🏔️ The Desert March (18 days, ~800 km)**

**📍 Route:** Iraq → Desert → Syria

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| 800 km of desert | Forced march |
| 18 days without water | Camels as living "tanks" 🐫 |
| Enemy alerted | SURPRISE arrival behind lines |

*Ḥīra →→→ 🏔️ →→→ Damascus*

</div>

The Byzantines didn't see him coming. Literally.

## 🏆 Yarmouk: The Masterpiece

The **Battle of Yarmouk** (15 AH) is considered one of history's most decisive battles.

| Army | Size |
|------|------|
| Muslims | ~30,000 |
| Byzantines | ~100,000+ |

### Tactical Genius

<div class="scene-box">

**⚔️ Battle of Yarmouk**

| Army | Size |
|------|------|
| Muslims | ~30,000 |
| Byzantines | ~100,000+ |

**🧠 Tactic:**

- Massive counter-attack
- The ravines prevent any Byzantine retreat

**📊 Result:**
- In **6 days**, the Byzantine army was annihilated
- The Empire lost Syria, Palestine, and Egypt

</div>

**One man** had changed the map of the world.

# Part III: Disgrace and Death 💔

## 😢 Dismissed by 'Umar

In the middle of the Battle of Yarmouk, 'Umar became caliph (Abū Bakr had just died).

His first decision: **dismiss Khālid**.

Why? Several reasons:

1. **Excesses** — Khālid had sometimes exceeded orders
2. **Popularity** — 'Umar feared people would attribute victories to Khālid, not Allah
3. **Pride** — Khālid had a certain ego

Khālid accepted without protest:

> "I hear and obey the Commander of the Believers."

He then served as an **ordinary soldier** under Abū 'Ubayda.

---

## 🌙 Death in His Bed

Khālid died in Homs in 21 AH—**in his bed**.

<div class="scene-box">

**💔 THE LION'S LAST WORDS**

*Khālid ibn al-Walīd, on his deathbed in Homs, looks at his body scarred by battles...*

**🔵 Khālid:** "I have fought in a hundred battles or so. There is not a spot on my body the size of a hand without a scar from a sword or spear. And here I am dying in my bed like a camel dies! May the eyes of cowards never sleep!"

*He had dreamed of dying a **shahīd** (martyr) on the battlefield.*

*Allah had decided otherwise.*

</div>

---

## 💎 Key Lessons

### 1. Repentance Erases Everything

Khālid **killed Muslims** at Uhud. Yet when he embraced Islam, everything was erased.

Don't say: "It's too late." **The door of repentance is open as long as the soul hasn't reached the throat.**

### 2. Talent Is an Amāna

His military genius was a **gift from Allah**. He used it to spread Islam.

Your talent — whatever it is — is an **amāna**. What are you using it for?

### 3. Obedience Above Ego

When 'Umar dismissed him, Khālid had a **loyal army** at his command.

But he **obeyed** the Caliph without hesitation. Obedience is greater than victory.

### 4. Death Is in Allah's Hands Alone

"The Sword of Allah" didn't die on the battlefield. He died in his bed.

On his deathbed, he said:

> "There isn't a span on my body without a wound from a spear or sword... And here I am dying in my bed like cattle die. May the eyes of cowards never sleep!"

**Allah decides. Not the sword or the spear.**
