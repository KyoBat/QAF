## 🌅 Before Islam: The Noble Merchant

### A Distinguished Man

'Uthmān was a man of **remarkable beauty** and **considerable wealth**:

- **Handsome face** — fair skin, thick beard
- **Wealthy merchant** — one of the most prosperous in Quraysh
- **Modest** — even before Islam, he avoided indecency
- **Educated** — he could read and write

> "'Uthmān never worshipped an idol, never drank alcohol, nor committed any indecent act, even during the Jāhiliyya."
> — **Reported by historians**

### The Title of Dhū al-Nūrayn

Why "the Possessor of **Two Lights**"?

Because he successively married **two daughters** of the Prophet ﷺ:

1. **Ruqayya** — who died during the Battle of Badr
2. **Umm Kulthūm** — who died in 9 AH

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **"لَوْ كَانَ لِي أَرْبَعُونَ بِنْتًا لَزَوَّجْتُهُ وَاحِدَةً بَعْدَ وَاحِدَةٍ حَتَّى لَا تَبْقَى مِنْهُنَّ وَاحِدَةٌ"**
> "If I had forty daughters, I would have married them to him one after another until none remained."

---

## ⚡ His Conversion

### Among the First

'Uthmān was among the **very first** to embrace Islam, even before Dār al-Arqam.

It was Abū Bakr who invited him to Islam. Without hesitation, he accepted.

His conversion provoked the **fury** of his uncle al-Ḥakam ibn Abī al-'Āṣ who tied him up and tortured him:

> "You abandon the religion of your fathers for a new religion? I will not release you!"

But 'Uthmān replied:

> **"وَاللهِ لَا أَدَعُهُ أَبَدًا"**
> "By Allah, I will never abandon it."

Faced with his determination, his uncle eventually released him.

## 🏆 His Accomplishments for Islam

### 1. The Two Hijras

'Uthmān was the only Companion to make **two hijras** with his family:

| Hijra | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **First** | To Abyssinia with Ruqayya |
| **Second** | To Medina |

The Prophet ﷺ said about them:

> **"إِنَّهُمَا لَأَوَّلُ مَنْ هَاجَرَ إِلَى اللهِ بَعْدَ لُوطٍ"**
> "They are the first to emigrate to Allah after Lūṭ."

---

### 2. The Purchase of the Well of Rūma

In Medina, Muslims suffered from lack of water. A Jew owned the well of Rūma and sold water at high prices.

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **"مَنْ يَشْتَرِي بِئْرَ رُومَةَ فَيَجْعَلَهَا لِلْمُسْلِمِينَ، وَلَهُ الْجَنَّةُ"**
> "Who will buy the well of Rūma for the Muslims? Paradise will be for him."

'Uthmān bought it for **35,000 dirhams** and made it a public endowment.

---

### 3. Equipping the Army of Tabūk

During the expedition of Tabūk (the most difficult), the Prophet ﷺ asked for contributions.

'Uthmān brought:

| Donation | Quantity |
|----------|----------|
| **Camels** | 300 equipped |
| **Horses** | 50 |
| **Gold** | 1,000 dinars (poured into the Prophet's ﷺ lap) |

The Prophet ﷺ, his hands full of gold, turned it over saying:

> **"مَا ضَرَّ عُثْمَانَ مَا عَمِلَ بَعْدَ الْيَوْمِ"**
> "Whatever he does after today will not harm him."

---

### 4. The Expansion of the Mosque

'Uthmān bought the lands adjacent to the Prophet's ﷺ Mosque to expand it, in **Medina** and again during his caliphate.

---

### 5. The Compilation of the Quran

The greatest accomplishment of 'Uthmān as caliph was the **official compilation** of the Quran.

**The context:**

After the conquests, Muslims from different regions were reciting the Quran with minor variations. Ḥudhayfa ibn al-Yamān warned:

> "O Commander of the Believers! Save this Umma before they differ over the Book like the Jews and Christians."

**The solution:**

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 The Compilation of the Quran**

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Gathering of original manuscripts |
| 2 | Commission led by Zayd ibn Thābit |
| 3 | Writing of a standard muṣḥaf (Quraysh dialect) |
| 4 | Sending copies to major cities |
| 5 | Destruction of non-conforming versions |

</div>

Thanks to 'Uthmān, the Quran is **unified** until today.

## 😢 His Trial and Martyrdom

### The Fitna

The last years of 'Uthmān's caliphate were marked by troubles.

Rebels from Egypt, Kufa, and Basra besieged his house in Medina, accusing him of nepotism.

**For 40 days**, 'Uthmān was besieged. His water was cut off. The Companions wanted to defend him, but he refused:

> **"أُقْسِمُ عَلَى كُلِّ مَنْ رَأَى لِي عَلَيْهِ حَقًّا أَنْ يَكُفَّ يَدَهُ"**
> "I adjure everyone who thinks they owe me anything to hold back their hand."

### The Dream of the Prophet ﷺ

The night before his assassination, 'Uthmān saw the Prophet ﷺ in a dream:

> **"أَفْطِرْ عِنْدَنَا الْلَّيْلَةَ"**
> "Break your fast with us tonight."

'Uthmān understood. He fasted that day.

### The Assassination

On 18 Dhū al-Ḥijja 35 AH, the rebels broke into his house.

'Uthmān was **reading the Quran**.

They struck him with swords. His blood flowed onto the muṣḥaf, on the verse:

> **﴾ فَسَيَكْفِيكَهُمُ اللَّهُ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ ﴿**
> "Allah will be sufficient for you against them. And He is the Hearing, the Knowing."
> — **[Sūrah Al-Baqara: 137]**

He died at **82 years old**, fasting, reading the Quran.

## 🔗 His Relationship with the Prophet ﷺ

### The Exceptional Modesty

One day, the Prophet ﷺ was lying in his home with his legs uncovered. Abū Bakr entered, then 'Umar. The Prophet ﷺ did not change his position.

Then 'Uthmān asked to enter. Immediately, the Prophet ﷺ **covered his legs**.

'Ā'isha asked:

— *"O Messenger of Allah, why did you do that for 'Uthmān and not for the others?"*

He replied:

> **"أَلَا أَسْتَحِي مِنْ رَجُلٍ تَسْتَحِي مِنْهُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ"**

### The Prophet ﷺ Announces His Martyrdom

One day, the Prophet ﷺ climbed Mount Uḥud with Abū Bakr, 'Umar, and 'Uthmān. The mountain shook.

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **"اثْبُتْ أُحُدُ، فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ نَبِيٌّ وَصِدِّيقٌ وَشَهِيدَانِ"**
> "Be still, Uḥud! You only bear a prophet, a ṣiddīq, and two martyrs."
