## Introduction

Fasting during the month of Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam. Allah تعالى says:

> **﴿ يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الصِّيَامُ كَمَا كُتِبَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ ﴾**
>
> *"O you who believe! Fasting has been prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, so that you may attain piety."* [Al-Baqara: 183]

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **« بُنِيَ الإِسْلاَمُ عَلَى خَمْسٍ: شَهَادَةِ أَنْ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ اللَّهِ، وَإِقَامِ الصَّلاَةِ، وَإِيتَاءِ الزَّكَاةِ، وَصَوْمِ رَمَضَانَ، وَحَجِّ الْبَيْتِ »**
>
> *"Islam is built upon five pillars: the testimony that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger, establishing the prayer, paying the Zakat, fasting Ramadan, and performing Hajj to the Sacred House."*
> — [Al-Bukhari (8) and Muslim (16)]

## 1. Definition of Fasting

### 1.1 Linguistic Definition (اللغوية)

The word **صِيَام** (Siyam) or **صَوْم** (Sawm) linguistically means: **abstention** (الإمساك).

Allah تعالى says about Maryam:

> **﴿ إِنِّي نَذَرْتُ لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ صَوْمًا ﴾**
>
> *"I have vowed a fast to the Most Merciful"* [Maryam: 26]

Here, fasting means abstaining from speech.

### 1.2 Legal Definition (الشرعية)

Fasting according to Islamic law is defined as:

> **الإمساك عن المفطرات من طلوع الفجر إلى غروب الشمس بنية**
>
> *"Abstaining from things that break the fast, from dawn until sunset, with intention."*

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **الإمساك** | Abstention |
| **المفطرات** | Nullifiers (food, drink, intercourse...) |
| **من طلوع الفجر** | From the true dawn (الفجر الصادق) |
| **إلى غروب الشمس** | Until sunset |
| **بنية** | With prior intention |

## 2. Legislation of Fasting (مشروعية الصيام)

### 2.1 From the Quran

Allah تعالى prescribed fasting for this nation as He prescribed it for previous nations:

> **﴿ شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ الَّذِي أُنزِلَ فِيهِ الْقُرْآنُ هُدًى لِّلنَّاسِ وَبَيِّنَاتٍ مِّنَ الْهُدَىٰ وَالْفُرْقَانِ ۚ فَمَن شَهِدَ مِنكُمُ الشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ ﴾**
>
> *"The month of Ramadan in which the Quran was revealed, as guidance for mankind and clear proofs of guidance and criterion. So whoever among you witnesses the month, let him fast it!"* [Al-Baqara: 185]

### 2.2 From the Sunnah

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **« إِذَا رَأَيْتُمُ الْهِلَالَ فَصُومُوا، وَإِذَا رَأَيْتُمُوهُ فَأَفْطِرُوا، فَإِنْ غُمَّ عَلَيْكُمْ فَاقْدُرُوا لَهُ »**
>
> *"When you see the crescent (of Ramadan), fast, and when you see it (of Shawwal), break the fast. If it is hidden from you (by clouds), then complete the count (of Sha'ban to 30 days)."*
> — [Al-Bukhari (1909) and Muslim (1081)]

### 2.3 Consensus (الإجماع)

The Muslim community is unanimous on the **obligation of fasting Ramadan** for every sane, adult Muslim who is able.

The Maliki school is distinguished by several points regarding fasting:

1. **Intention**: Must be made at night, before Fajr, for obligatory fasts
2. **Single intention**: Suffices for the entire month of Ramadan according to the preponderant view
3. **Rinsing the mouth (المضمضة)**: Does not break the fast even if water is swallowed unintentionally
