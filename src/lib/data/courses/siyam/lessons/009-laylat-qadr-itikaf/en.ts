Among the treasures of Ramadan, Laylat al-Qadr (the Night of Decree) and I'tikaf (spiritual retreat) hold a central place. These two practices allow the believer to reach the highest levels of spirituality.

> **Allah ﷻ says:** "Indeed, We sent it down during the Night of Decree. And what can make you know what is the Night of Decree? The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months."
> — *Surah Al-Qadr, 97:1-3*

## Part 1: Laylat al-Qadr (ليلة القدر)

### 1.1 Definition and Meaning

**Laylat al-Qadr** literally means:
- **The Night of Decree**: when the year's decrees are determined
- **The Night of Value**: due to its immense worth
- **The Night of Power**: from the power of worship on this night

### 1.2 Virtues of Laylat al-Qadr

> **The Prophet ﷺ said:** "Whoever stands (in prayer) during Laylat al-Qadr with faith and seeking reward, his previous sins will be forgiven."
> — *Reported by Al-Bukhari (1901) and Muslim (760)*

| Virtue | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Better than 1000 months** | More than 83 years of worship |
| **Forgiveness of past sins** | For those who observe it with faith |
| **Descent of angels** | Angels descend in abundance |
| **Peace until dawn** | Night of peace and tranquility |
| **Revelation of Quran** | Beginning of revelation |

### 1.3 When to Seek Laylat al-Qadr?

> **The Prophet ﷺ said:** "Seek Laylat al-Qadr in the last ten nights of Ramadan, in the odd nights."
> — *Reported by Al-Bukhari (2017) and Muslim (1169)*

| Night | Date | Priority |
|-------|------|----------|
| **21st night** | 21 Ramadan | ⭐⭐ |
| **23rd night** | 23 Ramadan | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **25th night** | 25 Ramadan | ⭐⭐ |
| **27th night** | 27 Ramadan | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (most likely) |
| **29th night** | 29 Ramadan | ⭐⭐ |

**Note:** The 27th night is most likely according to many hadiths, but it may vary from year to year. This is why the Prophet ﷺ recommended seeking it in all odd nights.

### 1.4 Wisdom Behind the Secret

> **Ibn 'Umar رضي الله عنهما said:** "Some companions saw Laylat al-Qadr in dreams during the last seven nights. The Prophet ﷺ said: 'I see your dreams agree on the last seven, so whoever seeks it should seek it in the last seven.'"

- To encourage effort in all nights
- To multiply good deeds
- To test the sincerity of worshippers
