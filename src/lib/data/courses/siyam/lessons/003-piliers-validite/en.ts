## Introduction

After studying the conditions of obligation for fasting, we now address what makes fasting valid. Allah تعالى says:

> **﴿ وَكُلُوا وَاشْرَبُوا حَتَّىٰ يَتَبَيَّنَ لَكُمُ الْخَيْطُ الْأَبْيَضُ مِنَ الْخَيْطِ الْأَسْوَدِ مِنَ الْفَجْرِ ۖ ثُمَّ أَتِمُّوا الصِّيَامَ إِلَى اللَّيْلِ ﴾**
>
> *"Eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct from the black thread. Then complete the fast until night."* [Al-Baqara: 187]

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **« مَنْ لَمْ يُبَيِّتِ الصِّيَامَ قَبْلَ الْفَجْرِ فَلَا صِيَامَ لَهُ »**
>
> *"Whoever does not form the intention to fast before Fajr has no fast."*
> — [Abu Dawud (2454), An-Nasai, At-Tirmidhi - Authenticated]

## Part One: The Pillars of Fasting (أركان الصيام)

**Pillars** (أركان) are the essential constituent elements without which fasting does not exist.

### Pillar 1: The Intention (النية)

#### 1.1 Definition and Importance

**Intention** is the determination of the heart to perform the fast for Allah تعالى.

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **« إِنَّمَا الْأَعْمَالُ بِالنِّيَّاتِ، وَإِنَّمَا لِكُلِّ امْرِئٍ مَا نَوَى »**
>
> *"Actions are only by intentions, and everyone will have only what they intended."*
> — [Al-Bukhari (1) and Muslim (1907)]

#### 1.2 Time of Intention

| Type of Fast | Time of Intention |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Ramadan** | Obligatorily at night, before Fajr |
| **Obligatory fast (vow, expiation)** | Obligatorily at night, before Fajr |
| **Voluntary fast** | Possible until midday (before Zawal) |

#### 1.3 Differences on Renewing the Intention

| School | Position for Ramadan |
|--------|---------------------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | A single intention at the beginning of the month suffices (predominant view) |
| 🔵 **Hanafi** | A single intention suffices |
| 🟢 **Shafi'i** | Renew each night |
| 🔴 **Hanbali** | Renew each night |

**Maliki Evidence:** Ramadan is a continuous act of worship, like a multi-unit prayer where a single intention suffices.

#### 1.4 Formulation of Intention

The intention is made **in the heart** and not on the tongue. It is not prescribed to pronounce it.

❌ **Bid'a**: Saying "Nawaytou an asooma ghadan..." is not a sunnah

✅ **Correct**: Having a firm resolution in the heart to fast for Allah

---

### Pillar 2: Abstention (الإمساك)

#### 2.1 Definition

**Abstention** from things that break the fast (المفطرات) from dawn until sunset.

#### 2.2 Time of Abstention

| Beginning | End |
|-----------|-----|
| **الفجر الصادق** (True dawn) | **غروب الشمس** (Sunset) |
| When the white thread is distinguished from the black | When the solar disk completely disappears |

#### 2.3 The Difference Between the Two Dawns

| الفجر الكاذب (False dawn) | الفجر الصادق (True dawn) |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Vertical light then darkness | Horizontal spreading light |
| Eating still permitted | Beginning of abstention |
| Fajr prayer not valid | Fajr prayer valid |

---

## Part Two: Conditions of Validity (شروط صحة الصيام)

**Conditions of validity** are the criteria that must be met for fasting to be accepted.

### Condition 1: Islam

Fasting is only valid for a Muslim. If a non-Muslim fasts, their fast is not valid.

---

### Condition 2: Discernment (التمييز)

#### 2.1 Definition

**Discernment** is the ability to understand what one is doing. The age of discernment is generally set at **7 years**.

#### 2.2 Application

| Person | Validity of fasting |
|--------|---------------------|
| Child under 7 years | Not valid (no discernment) |
| Child 7 years and older | Valid but not obligatory |
| Sane adult | Valid and obligatory |

---

### Condition 3: Absence of Menstruation and Post-natal Bleeding

The fasting of a woman in menstruation or post-natal bleeding is **not valid**, even if she fasts.

---

### Condition 4: Purity from Major Impurity 🟡

#### 4.1 The Case of Janaba (Major Impurity)

| School | Position |
|--------|----------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | Fasting is valid even if waking in a state of janaba, provided ghusl is done promptly |
| Other schools | Same position |

**Evidence:**

'Aisha and Umm Salama رضي الله عنهما said:

> **« كَانَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ ﷺ يُدْرِكُهُ الْفَجْرُ وَهُوَ جُنُبٌ مِنْ أَهْلِهِ، ثُمَّ يَغْتَسِلُ وَيَصُومُ »**
>
> *"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ would wake up in a state of janaba (from relations with his wives), then make ghusl and fast."*
> — [Al-Bukhari (1925) and Muslim (1109)]

---

### Condition 5: Appropriate Time

One cannot fast on forbidden days:

| Forbidden Days | Evidence |
|----------------|----------|
| **Day of Eid Al-Fitr** | Hadith: "Two days the Prophet ﷺ forbade fasting..." |
| **Day of Eid Al-Adha** | [Al-Bukhari (1990) and Muslim (1137)] |
| **Days of Tashriq** (11, 12, 13 Dhul-Hijja) | Except for pilgrims without a sacrifice |

---

## Comparative Table: Pillars vs Conditions

| Aspect | Pillars (أركان) | Conditions (شروط) |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Definition** | Constituent elements of fasting | Criteria of validity |
| **Absence** | Fasting does not exist | Fasting is not valid |
| **Examples** | Intention, Abstention | Islam, Discernment, Absence of menses |

---

## Focus on Intention According to the Maliki School 🟡

### Key Points

1. **A single intention** at the beginning of Ramadan suffices for the entire month
2. **Doubt** in intention does not invalidate fasting if the base intention was firm
3. **Interruption** of fasting (travel, illness) requires a new intention upon return
4. **The traveler's fast** who decides to fast must have the intention before Fajr

### Special Cases

| Situation | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Forgot intention before Fajr (Ramadan) | Fast not valid, must make up |
| Intended to break without actually breaking | Fast broken according to some scholars |
| Uncertainty about the day (29 or 30 Sha'ban) | Conditional intention permitted |

---

## The Precise Time of Suhur and Iftar

### Suhur (السحور)

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **« تَسَحَّرُوا فَإِنَّ فِي السَّحُورِ بَرَكَةً »**
>
> *"Take the suhur, for there is blessing in the suhur."*
> — [Al-Bukhari (1923) and Muslim (1095)]

**Recommendations:**
- Delay suhur until close to Fajr
- Stop at the adhan or slightly before as a precaution

### Iftar (الإفطار)

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **« لَا يَزَالُ النَّاسُ بِخَيْرٍ مَا عَجَّلُوا الْفِطْرَ »**
>
> *"People will continue to be in good as long as they hasten to break their fast."*
> — [Al-Bukhari (1957) and Muslim (1098)]

**The exact moment:**
- As soon as the sun completely disappears below the horizon
- No need to wait for total darkness

---

## Summary Table

| Element | Type | Detail |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Intention** | Pillar | Before Fajr for obligatory |
| **Abstention** | Pillar | From dawn to sunset |
| **Islam** | Condition | Essential |
| **Discernment** | Condition | Generally 7 years |
| **Purity from menses** | Condition | Woman must be pure |
| **Appropriate time** | Condition | Avoid forbidden days |

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ Pronouncing the intention out loud
2. ❌ Thinking that waking up in janaba invalidates the fast
3. ❌ Continuing to eat after the adhan "to finish the bite"
4. ❌ Waiting for darkness to break the fast
5. ❌ Believing that swallowing saliva breaks the fast
