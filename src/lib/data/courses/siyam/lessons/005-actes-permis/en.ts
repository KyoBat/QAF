## Introduction

Allah تعالى made fasting obligatory while granting ease to His servants. Knowing what is permitted helps the fasting person live their worship serenely. Allah تعالى says:

> **﴿ يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ بِكُمُ الْيُسْرَ وَلَا يُرِيدُ بِكُمُ الْعُسْرَ ﴾**
>
> *"Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship."* [Al-Baqara: 185]

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **« إِنَّ الدِّينَ يُسْرٌ، وَلَنْ يُشَادَّ الدِّينَ أَحَدٌ إِلَّا غَلَبَهُ »**
>
> *"The religion is easy. Whoever tries to make the religion difficult will be overcome by it."*
> — [Al-Bukhari (39)]

## The Spirit of Fasting

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **« مَنْ لَمْ يَدَعْ قَوْلَ الزُّورِ وَالْعَمَلَ بِهِ فَلَيْسَ لِلَّهِ حَاجَةٌ فِي أَنْ يَدَعَ طَعَامَهُ وَشَرَابَهُ »**
>
> *"Whoever does not leave false speech and acting upon it, Allah has no need for him to leave his food and drink."*
> — [Al-Bukhari (1903)]

Fasting is not merely abstention from food, but a school of spirituality and purification of the soul.
