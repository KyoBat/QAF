## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### 🤰 Case 1: The Pregnant Woman Worried About Her Baby

> **Situation:** Khadija is 6 months pregnant. She feels capable of fasting but is worried about her baby's development. Her doctor says fasting is not medically contraindicated.

**❓ Can she break her fast as a precaution?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the answer</summary>

**Analysis:**

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Justified fear | Medical consultation needed |
| Medical opinion | Doctor says it's possible |
| Mere worry | Not sufficient grounds |

The dispensation is granted in case of **real fear** for the health of mother or baby, not just precaution. If the doctor confirms fasting is possible, she must fast.

> 💡 **Rule:** According to Malikis, if she breaks fast due to justified fear, she only needs to **make up** without additional fidya.

</details>

### 🍼 Case 2: The Breastfeeding Mother

> **Situation:** Fatima is exclusively breastfeeding her 4-month-old baby. She notices her milk decreases when she fasts and the baby cries a lot.

**❓ Can she break her fast?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the answer</summary>

**Analysis:**

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Exclusive breastfeeding | Baby depends entirely on breast milk |
| Milk decrease | Observable effect |
| Impact on child | Crying, hunger of the infant |

The nursing woman may break her fast if she fears for herself or her child. Milk decrease affecting the infant is a legitimate concern.

> 💡 **Rule:** She breaks fast and **makes up after weaning**. According to Malikis, no fidya in addition to making up.

</details>

### 💉 Case 3: The Insulin-Dependent Diabetic

> **Situation:** Ahmed, 55 years old, has Type 2 diabetes and takes insulin. He needs to inject insulin and monitor his blood sugar several times daily. He still wants to fast.

**❓ When does diabetes become a valid excuse?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the answer</summary>

**Analysis:**

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Type of diabetes | Type 2 with insulin = moderate to high risk |
| Medical risk | Hypoglycemia, imbalance |
| Medical opinion | Essential |

Diabetes becomes a valid excuse when:
1. The doctor explicitly advises against fasting
2. Past experience shows complications
3. There is risk to life or permanent damage

| Situation | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Balanced diabetes without risk | Must fast |
| Moderate risk diabetes | May break + make up |
| Uncontrollable diabetes | Permanent fidya |

> 💡 **Rule:** **Medical consultation** is obligatory. Insulin injection **does not** invalidate fasting.

</details>

### 📚 Case 4: Exam Period and Mental Exhaustion

> **Situation:** Youssef is a medical student. His final exams fall during Ramadan. He says fasting prevents him from concentrating and he might fail his year.

**❓ Are exams an excuse to break fast?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the answer</summary>

**Analysis:**

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Mental difficulty | Not recognized as excuse |
| Fatigue/concentration | Not an illness |
| Academic stakes | Do not justify breaking fast |

Mental difficulty and intellectual fatigue **are not valid excuses** for breaking fast. Millions of Muslims study and take exams during Ramadan.

| Valid excuse | Invalid excuse |
|--------------|----------------|
| Physical illness | Mental fatigue |
| Travel | Exams |
| Pregnancy/nursing | Intellectual work |

> 💡 **Rule:** Youssef must fast and **adapt his schedule**: study after Fajr, eat well at Suhur and Iftar.

</details>

### ⏰ Case 5: Deadline for Making Up Missed Days

> **Situation:** Maryam missed 10 days of Ramadan last year. She still hasn't made them up and the new Ramadan is coming in 2 weeks.

**❓ What is the deadline for making up?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the answer</summary>

**Analysis:**

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Legal deadline | Before the next Ramadan |
| Days remaining | 2 weeks = 14 days |
| Days to make up | 10 days |

Maryam can still make up 10 days in 14 days. She must start immediately.

| Situation | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| Make up before Ramadan | Making up only |
| Delay without excuse | Making up + Fidya per day |
| Delay with excuse (continuous illness) | Making up only |

> 💡 **Rule:** If she doesn't make up in time without valid excuse, she must do **Qada after this Ramadan** + pay **Fidya** (feed 1 poor person per delayed day).

</details>

## 💭 Reflection

> *Dispensations are a manifestation of divine mercy. Allah says: "يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ بِكُمُ الْيُسْرَ وَلَا يُرِيدُ بِكُمُ الْعُسْرَ" — Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship. However, this ease should not become a pretext for abandoning worship. The believer must sincerely seek to fulfill their duty while recognizing their real limitations.*

## 🎯 Practical Action Plan

| Phase | Steps |
|-------|-------|
| **For Those with Excuses** | Know the ruling for your excuse • Count missed days • Hasten to make up after excuse ends • Pay fidya if required |
