Allah ﷻ has legislated fasting while granting exemptions to those who cannot observe it temporarily or permanently, manifesting His mercy towards His servants.

> **Allah ﷻ says:** "And whoever is ill or on a journey, then an equal number of other days. Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship."
> — *Surah Al-Baqara, 2:185*

## 4. Women's Specific Rulings

### 4.1 Menstruation (Hayd) and Postpartum Bleeding (Nifas)

> **'Aisha رضي الله عنها said:** "We used to menstruate during the time of the Prophet ﷺ, and he would command us to make up the fasts but did not command us to make up the prayers."
> — *Reported by Al-Bukhari (321) and Muslim (335)*

**Essential Rules:**
- ❌ **Forbidden** to fast during menstruation and postpartum bleeding
- ✅ **Obligatory** to make up after purification
- Fasting performed during this time is **invalid**

### 4.2 Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

> **Anas ibn Malik Al-Ka'bi رضي الله عنه narrated** that the Prophet ﷺ said: "Allah has relieved the traveler of fasting and half of the prayer, and the pregnant and breastfeeding woman [of fasting]."
> — *Reported by At-Tirmidhi (715), An-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah*

| Situation | Fear For | Obligation | Maliki School 🟡 |
|-----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Pregnant | Herself | Qada only | Qada only |
| Pregnant | The child | Qada + Fidya (some say) | Qada only 🟡 |
| Breastfeeding | Herself | Qada only | Qada only |
| Breastfeeding | The child | Qada + Fidya (some say) | Qada only 🟡 |

**Maliki Note 🟡:** Imam Malik considers only Qada obligatory for pregnant and breastfeeding women, without additional Fidya, contrary to the view of some Shafi'is and Hanbalis.

| Aspect | Ruling |
|--------|--------|
| **Deadline** | Before the next Ramadan |
| **Consecutive** | Not obligatory (recommended) |
| **Intention** | Required from the night before (🟡 Maliki) |

### 5.2 Delaying the Make-Up

> **'Aisha رضي الله عنها said:** "I would have fasts from Ramadan to make up, and I could not make them up except in Sha'ban."
> — *Reported by Al-Bukhari (1950) and Muslim (1146)*

| Situation | Consequence | Maliki School 🟡 |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| Unjustified delay until next Ramadan | Qada + Fidya (majority) | Qada + Fidya 🟡 |
| Delay with valid excuse | Qada only | Qada only |
| Multiple years of delay | Accumulated Qada + Fidya per year | Same |

### 5.3 Fidya for Unjustified Delay

**Amount of Fidya:** Feed one poor person per missed day (approximately 1 mudd ≈ 750g of staple food)

|-----------|--------|
| Death before able to make up | Nothing is owed |
| Death after ability but didn't make up | Fidya from inheritance |

> **The Prophet ﷺ said:** "Whoever dies while having fasts to make up, his guardian (wali) should fast on his behalf."
> — *Reported by Al-Bukhari (1952) and Muslim (1147)*
