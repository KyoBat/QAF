The end of Ramadan is crowned by two major acts: Zakat Al-Fitr (the charity of breaking fast) and the celebration of Eid Al-Fitr. These two practices manifest gratitude towards Allah and solidarity among Muslims.

> **Ibn 'Umar رضي الله عنهما said:** "The Messenger of Allah ﷺ prescribed Zakat Al-Fitr: a sa' of dates or a sa' of barley, for the slave and the free, male and female, young and old among Muslims. And he ordered it to be given before people go out for the prayer (of Eid)."
> — *Reported by Al-Bukhari (1503) and Muslim (984)*
