## Introduction

Fasting during Ramadan is an obligation for every Muslim, but this obligation is subject to certain conditions. Allah تعالى says:

> **﴿ فَمَن شَهِدَ مِنكُمُ الشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ ۖ وَمَن كَانَ مَرِيضًا أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ فَعِدَّةٌ مِّنْ أَيَّامٍ أُخَرَ ﴾**
>
> *"So whoever among you witnesses the month, let him fast it. And whoever is ill or on a journey, then an equal number of other days."* [Al-Baqara: 185]

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **« رُفِعَ الْقَلَمُ عَنْ ثَلاَثَةٍ: عَنِ النَّائِمِ حَتَّى يَسْتَيْقِظَ، وَعَنِ الصَّبِيِّ حَتَّى يَحْتَلِمَ، وَعَنِ الْمَجْنُونِ حَتَّى يَعْقِلَ »**
>
> *"The pen is lifted from three: from the sleeper until he wakes, from the child until he reaches puberty, and from the insane until he regains his sanity."*
> — [Abu Dawud (4403), An-Nasai, Ibn Majah - Authenticated by Al-Albani]
