## Introduction

Knowing what invalidates fasting is essential to preserve one's worship. Allah تعالى says:

> **﴿ ثُمَّ أَتِمُّوا الصِّيَامَ إِلَى اللَّيْلِ ۚ وَلَا تُبَاشِرُوهُنَّ وَأَنتُمْ عَاكِفُونَ فِي الْمَسَاجِدِ ﴾**
>
> *"Then complete the fast until night. And do not have relations with them while you are in spiritual retreat in the mosques."* [Al-Baqara: 187]

The Prophet ﷺ said in a Hadith Qudsi that Allah تعالى said:

> **« يَتْرُكُ طَعَامَهُ وَشَرَابَهُ وَشَهْوَتَهُ مِنْ أَجْلِي »**
>
> *"He (the fasting person) leaves his food, drink, and desire for My sake."*
> — [Al-Bukhari (1904) and Muslim (1151)]

## Classification of Nullifiers

Nullifiers of fasting are divided into two categories:

| Category | Consequence | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Nullifiers requiring Qada only** | Make-up | Eating forgetfully then continuing after remembering |
| **Nullifiers requiring Qada + Kaffara** | Make-up + Expiation | Voluntary intercourse (under conditions) |

---

## 1. Eating and Drinking Voluntarily (الأكل والشرب عمداً)

### 1.1 The General Rule

Any voluntary introduction of food or drink into the body through the normal passage (mouth) nullifies the fast.

### 1.2 Conditions for Nullification

For the fast to be nullified, there must be:

1. **Intention** (القصد): The act is voluntary
2. **Awareness** (التذكر): The person knows they are fasting
3. **Absence of coercion** (عدم الإكراه): No force majeure

### 1.3 The Case of Forgetfulness

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **« مَنْ نَسِيَ وَهُوَ صَائِمٌ فَأَكَلَ أَوْ شَرِبَ فَلْيُتِمَّ صَوْمَهُ، فَإِنَّمَا أَطْعَمَهُ اللَّهُ وَسَقَاهُ »**
>
> *"Whoever forgets while fasting and eats or drinks, let him complete his fast, for it is Allah who fed and gave him drink."*
> — [Al-Bukhari (1933) and Muslim (1155)]

| Situation | Fasting status |
|-----------|----------------|
| Eating/drinking forgetfully | ✅ Valid - continue |
| Eating/drinking voluntarily | ❌ Nullified - Qada |
| Eating/drinking under coercion | ✅ Valid according to predominant view |

---

## 2. Sexual Intercourse (الجماع)

### 2.1 Nullification

Sexual intercourse during the day of Ramadan nullifies the fast and requires:
- **Qada** (make-up)
- **Kaffara** (expiation) for Ramadan fasting

### 2.2 The Kaffara (الكفارة)

The evidence is the hadith of the man who came to the Prophet ﷺ:

> **« هَلَكْتُ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ! قَالَ: مَا أَهْلَكَكَ؟ قَالَ: وَقَعْتُ عَلَى امْرَأَتِي فِي رَمَضَانَ... »**
>
> *"I am ruined, O Messenger of Allah! He said: What ruined you? He said: I had relations with my wife during Ramadan..."*
> — [Al-Bukhari (1936) and Muslim (1111)]

### 2.3 Order of Kaffara

| Order | Expiation | Condition |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Free a slave | If possible |

## 4. Provoked Vomiting (الاستقاءة)

>
