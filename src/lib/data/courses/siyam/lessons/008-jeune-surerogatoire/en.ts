export const content = `# Voluntary Fasting (صيام التطوع)

Beyond the obligatory fast of Ramadan, Islam encourages voluntary fasts that bring the servant closer to their Lord and multiply their rewards.

> **The Prophet ﷺ said:** "Whoever fasts a day in the path of Allah, Allah will distance his face from the Hellfire by seventy years."
> — *Reported by Al-Bukhari (2840) and Muslim (1153)*

## 1. Virtues of Voluntary Fasting

### 1.1 General Rewards

> **In a Hadith Qudsi, Allah ﷻ says:** "Every deed of the son of Adam belongs to him, except fasting. It belongs to Me and I reward for it."
> — *Reported by Al-Bukhari (1904) and Muslim (1151)*

| Virtue | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Distances from Hellfire | Hadith of 70 years |
| Limitless reward | Hadith Qudsi |
| Intercession on Judgment Day | Hadith of Ahmad |
| Special gate to Paradise (Ar-Rayyan) | Al-Bukhari and Muslim |

### 1.2 Fasting Completes Obligations

> **The Prophet ﷺ said:** "The first thing the servant will be judged for on the Day of Resurrection is the prayer. If it is incomplete, Allah will say: 'Look if My servant has any voluntary prayers.' If he does, they will complete the obligatory ones. And so it will be for all deeds."
> — *Reported by Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi*

## 2. The Six Days of Shawwal

### 2.1 Exceptional Merit

> **Abu Ayyub Al-Ansari رضي الله عنه narrated** that the Prophet ﷺ said: "Whoever fasts Ramadan then follows it with six days of Shawwal, it is as if he fasted the entire year."
> — *Reported by Muslim (1164)*

**Calculation:**
- Ramadan (30 days) × 10 = 300 days
- 6 days of Shawwal × 10 = 60 days
- Total = 360 days = 1 year

### 2.2 Rules for the Six Days

| Aspect | Ruling | Maliki School 🟡 |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Timing | Anytime in Shawwal | Preferable after a few days |
| Consecutive | Not obligatory | Not obligatory |
| Before Qada | 🟡 Difference | Qada first is recommended 🟡 |
| First day | After Eid (2nd Shawwal) | Same |

**Maliki Note 🟡:** Imam Malik disliked people fasting the 6 days immediately after Eid, fearing they might think it obligatory. He recommended spacing them out.
