## 🌍 Contemporary Applications

### Calculating Fidya and Expiation

**Fidya:**
- 30 days × 750 grams = 22.5 kg of food
- Or: 30 × 7 euros = approximately 210 euros

**Expiation by Feeding:**
- 60 poor people × mudd = 45 kg of food
- Or: 60 × 7 euros = approximately 420 euros

### Methods of Payment

| Method | Note |
|--------|------|
| Giving food directly | Primary method |
| Delegating to charitable organizations | Permissible |
| Paying cash value | According to those who permit (Hanafis) |

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### 🚫 Case 1: Intentional Breaking Without Valid Excuse

> **Situation:** Karim, 28 years old, in good health, intentionally broke his fast one day of Ramadan simply because he wanted to eat. He had no legal excuse.

**❓ What expiation must he do?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the answer</summary>

**Analysis:**

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Type of breaking | Eating intentionally |
| Valid excuse | None |
| School concerned | Maliki vs. others |

According to the **Malikis**, eating intentionally without excuse is a grave sin but **does not require kaffara** (major expiation). Only intimate relations require kaffara.

| School | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| 🟡 Maliki | Qada + sincere repentance |
| 🟢 Hanafi | Kaffara (according to some) |

> 💡 **Rule:** Karim must **make up that day** + make **sincere repentance** (tawba). No kaffara according to Malikis for eating.

</details>

### 👴 Case 2: Permanent Inability to Fast

> **Situation:** Hajja Aicha, 85 years old, can no longer fast due to extreme weakness. She wants to know how to calculate her fidya for 30 days.

**❓ How to calculate fidya in euros/dollars?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the answer</summary>

**Analysis:**

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Age | 85 years, permanent incapacity |
| Type of obligation | Permanent fidya |
| Calculation | 1 mudd per day |

To calculate fidya:
1. **1 mudd** = approximately 750g of staple food
2. **Value of one meal** = 5-7 € depending on country
3. **30 days** × 7 € = **210 €** (high estimate)

| Calculation | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| In food | 30 × 750g = 22.5 kg of rice/wheat |
| In cash | 30 × 6-7 € = 180-210 € |

> 💡 **Rule:** Hajja Aicha can give **22.5 kg of food** or its cash equivalent to the poor. Can be given to one poor person or distributed.

</details>

### 🔄 Case 3: Repeated Offenses in Same Ramadan

> **Situation:** Omar had intimate relations with his wife on 3 different days of Ramadan. He asks how many kaffara he owes.

**❓ Are multiple kaffara required for multiple days?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the answer</summary>

**Analysis:**

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Type of offense | Intimate relations (kaffara required) |
| Days concerned | 3 different days |
| School | Major disagreement |

This is a question where schools diverge strongly:

| School | Number of kaffara |
|--------|-------------------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | **3 kaffara** (1 per day) |
| 🟢 Hanafi | 1 single kaffara |
| 🔵 Shafi'i | 1 single kaffara |
| 🟣 Hanbali | 1 single kaffara |

> 💡 **Maliki Rule:** Omar owes **3 kaffara** + make up 3 days. Each kaffara = fast 60 consecutive days OR feed 60 poor people.

</details>

### 💸 Case 4: Unable to Afford Kaffara

> **Situation:** Bilal committed a sin requiring kaffara but he is very poor. He cannot fast 60 days (exhausting physical labor) nor feed 60 poor people.

**❓ What are the alternatives?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the answer</summary>

**Analysis:**

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Financial capacity | Poor |
| Physical capacity | Cannot fast 60 days |
| Situation | Total incapacity |

The hadith of the man who came to the Prophet ﷺ shows the solution:

| Level | Option | Bilal's status |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Free a slave | Impossible (no longer exists) |
| 2 | Fast 60 days | Incapable (work) |
| 3 | Feed 60 poor | Incapable (poor) |

The Prophet ﷺ gave that man dates to distribute, then when the man said he was the poorest of his household, the Prophet allowed him to eat them.

> 💡 **Rule:** In case of **total incapacity**, the kaffara **falls temporarily** but remains a debt. When he becomes able, he must fulfill it.

</details>

### ⏰ Case 5: Delaying Makeup Beyond Next Ramadan

> **Situation:** Salma had to make up 15 days from Ramadan 2023. She couldn't due to pregnancy then breastfeeding. Ramadan 2025 is coming and she still hasn't made them up.

**❓ What does she owe now?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the answer</summary>

**Analysis:**

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Delay duration | 2 years |
| Reason for delay | Pregnancy then breastfeeding |
| Type of excuse | Valid continuous excuse |

Delay due to **valid excuse** (illness, pregnancy, breastfeeding) does not generate additional fidya.

| Situation | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| Delay with valid excuse | Qada only |
| Delay without excuse (negligence) | Qada + Fidya per day of delay |

For Salma:
- Pregnancy then breastfeeding = **valid continuous excuse**
- Therefore: **15 days of Qada only**
- No fidya for the delay

> 💡 **Rule:** Salma must make up her 15 days as soon as possible. Since her excuse was valid, **no fidya** for the delay. Had the delay been due to negligence, she would owe 15 × fidya.

</details>

## 💭 Reflection

> *Kaffara is not punishment but mercy. It allows the sinner to purify themselves and repair their fault. The hadith of the man who came to the Prophet ﷺ, distressed from breaking his fast through intimate relations, shows that the door of repentance always remains open. Allah accepts sincere repentance and has provided means of purification suited to every situation.*

## 🎯 Practical Action Plan

| Phase | Steps |
|-------|-------|
| **For Expiation** | Repent and seek forgiveness • Determine type you can do • Hasten to fulfill • Make up invalidated day |
| **For Fidya** | Count the days • Calculate required amount • Give to those entitled |
