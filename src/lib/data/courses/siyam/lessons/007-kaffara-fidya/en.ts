export const content = `# Expiation (Kaffara) and Fidya

When a person intentionally breaks their Ramadan fast through a forbidden act, Allah ﷻ has legislated an expiation (Kaffara) to purify this sin. Fidya, on the other hand, is compensation for those who cannot fast.

> **Abu Hurayra رضي الله عنه narrated:** A man came to the Prophet ﷺ and said: "I am ruined!" The Prophet ﷺ asked: "What has ruined you?" He said: "I had intercourse with my wife during Ramadan."
> — *Reported by Al-Bukhari (1936) and Muslim (1111)*

## 1. Kaffara (الكَفَّارة) - Expiation

### 1.1 Definition

**Kaffara** is an obligatory expiation imposed on one who intentionally breaks the fast of a Ramadan day through sexual intercourse without a valid excuse.

### 1.2 Cases Requiring Kaffara

| Act | Kaffara Required? | Details |
|-----|-------------------|---------|
| **Intentional intercourse** | ✅ Yes | Scholarly consensus |
| **Intentional eating/drinking** | 🟡 Difference | Yes (Malikis 🟡) / No (majority) |
| **Breaking by forgetfulness** | ❌ No | Continue fasting |
| **Breaking under coercion** | ❌ No | No sin |

**Maliki Position 🟡:** The Malikis hold that Kaffara is also due for any intentional breaking of the fast (eating, drinking), not just intercourse.

### 1.3 Conditions for Kaffara Obligation

1. **Being adult and sane**
2. **Fasting an obligatory day of Ramadan**
3. **Breaking intentionally without excuse**
4. **Knowing the prohibition**
5. **The act must be complete** (for intercourse)

---

## 2. The Three Levels of Kaffara

Kaffara must be performed in a **specific order** (الترتيب). One only moves to the next level when unable to fulfill the previous one.

### Reference Hadith:

> **The Prophet ﷺ said to the man:** "Can you free a slave?" He said: "No." He said: "Can you fast two consecutive months?" He said: "No." He said: "Can you feed sixty poor people?" He said: "No."
> — *Reported by Al-Bukhari (1936) and Muslim (1111)*

### 2.1 First Level: Freeing a Slave

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Condition** | Must be a believing slave |
| **Today** | Inapplicable (slavery abolished) |
| **Result** | Move to 2nd level |

### 2.2 Second Level: Fasting 2 Consecutive Months

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Duration** | 60 consecutive days |
| **Consecutiveness** | Obligatory |
| **Permitted interruption** | Menstruation, sudden illness |
| **Invalidating interruption** | Voluntary travel, breaking without excuse |

**Important:**
- If interrupted without excuse → start over from the beginning
- Eid days are forbidden for fasting → choose a period avoiding these days
- 🟡 Malikis allow starting anytime as long as forbidden days are avoided

### 2.3 Third Level: Feeding 60 Poor People

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Quantity** | 1 mudd per poor person (≈ 750g) |
| **Food** | Staple food of the country |
| **Beneficiaries** | 60 different poor people |
| **Alternative** | Giving monetary equivalent (🟡 permitted by some) |

**Practical Calculation:**
- 1 mudd ≈ 750g of wheat, rice, or dates
- For 60 poor people = approximately 45 kg of food
- Or monetary equivalent of average meal × 60

## 3. Kaffara Summary Table

| Level | Action | Condition | Notes |
|-------|--------|-----------|-------|
| **1st** | Free a slave | Being capable | Inapplicable today |
| **2nd** | Fast 60 consecutive days | Inability for 1st | Most common |
| **3rd** | Feed 60 poor people | Inability for 2nd | For the ill |

---

## 4. Special Cases of Kaffara

### 4.1 Multiple Days Broken

| Situation | Kaffara Due | Maliki School 🟡 |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| Multiple days, same Ramadan | 1 single Kaffara | 1 Kaffara per day 🟡 |
| Days in different Ramadans | 1 Kaffara per Ramadan | 1 Kaffara per day 🟡 |

**Maliki Position 🟡:** Each day broken requires its own Kaffara, even in the same Ramadan.

### 4.2 The Woman

| Situation | Kaffara for her? |
|-----------|------------------|
| Consenting | ✅ Yes (according to majority) |
| Forced | ❌ No |
| Ignorant of prohibition | ❌ No |

### 4.3 Total Inability

> **In the continuation of the hadith:** A basket of dates was brought to the Prophet ﷺ. He said: "Give this in charity." The man said: "To someone poorer than me? There is no family between the two mountains of Medina poorer than mine." The Prophet ﷺ laughed until his molars showed, then said: "Feed it to your family."
> — *Reported by Al-Bukhari (1936) and Muslim (1111)*

**Conclusion:** In case of total inability, the Kaffara is waived.

## 5. Fidya (الفِدْية) - Compensation

### 5.1 Definition

**Fidya** is food compensation owed by those who cannot fast and will never be able to make it up.

### 5.2 Who Must Pay

| Category | Obligation | Evidence |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **Very elderly person** | Fidya | Quran 2:184 |
| **Chronically ill person** | Fidya | Quran 2:184 |
| **Delayed Qada without excuse** | Fidya (+ Qada) | Companions' opinions |

> **Allah ﷻ says:** "And upon those who can [only with hardship] fast, a ransom: feeding a poor person."
> — *Surah Al-Baqara, 2:184*

### 5.3 Amount of Fidya

| School | Quantity | Modern Equivalent |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **Maliki 🟡** | 1 mudd (≈ 750g) of food | About $5-8 |
| **Hanafi** | 1/2 sa' (≈ 1.5 kg) | About $8-12 |
| **Shafi'i** | 1 mudd of wheat | About $5-8 |
| **Hanbali** | 1 mudd of wheat | About $5-8 |

### 5.4 Detailed Maliki 🟡 Calculation

| Element | Quantity |
|---------|----------|
| **Per day** | 1 mudd (≈ 750g) |
| **For 30 days** | 30 mudds (≈ 22.5 kg) |
| **In money** | Equivalent of average meal × 30 |

**Calculation Method:**
1. Average price of a meal in the country = X
2. Fidya per day = X
3. Fidya for Ramadan = X × 30

### 5.5 Payment Methods

| Option | Permitted? | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Give each day | ✅ Yes | Preferable |
| Give all at beginning | ✅ Yes | Permitted |
| Give all at end | ✅ Yes | Permitted |
| Give to one poor person | 🟡 Difference | Permitted (Maliki) |

| **Order** | 3 ordered levels | Feeding only |
| **Quantity** | 60 poor people | 1 poor person/day |
| **With Qada** | ✅ Yes (Qada also obligatory) | ❌ No (no Qada) |

## 9. Spiritual Counsel

Kaffara and Fidya are not mere financial penalties. They are:

1. **Purification** from the sin committed
2. **A reminder** of the gravity of breaking the fast
3. **Solidarity** with the poor
4. **Divine wisdom** combining justice and mercy

> **Ibn Al-Qayyim رحمه الله said:** "The wisdom of Kaffara is to make the soul taste difficulty to prevent recurrence, while expiating the sin."
