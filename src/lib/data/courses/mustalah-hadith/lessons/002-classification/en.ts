## 📚 The Sahih Hadith (الحديث الصحيح)

### 🔷 Definition

> **الصحيح**: A hadith with continuous chain, transmitted by a narrator of probity and precision, from his like, to its source, without anomaly or hidden defect.

### 📊 The 5 Conditions of Sahih

| # | Condition | Arabic | Explanation |
|---|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 1️⃣ | **Continuous chain** | اتصال السند | Each narrator received from the one before |
| 2️⃣ | **Narrator's probity** | عدالة الراوي | Muslim, adult, sane, no major sins |
| 3️⃣ | **Narrator's precision** | ضبط الراوي | Exact memory or preserved book |
| 4️⃣ | **No anomaly** | عدم الشذوذ | Doesn't contradict more reliable narrators |
| 5️⃣ | **No hidden defect** | عدم العلة | No 'Illa discovered by experts |

### 🔷 Levels of Sahih

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Muttafaq 'Alayhi** | Reported by Bukhari AND Muslim |
| **2. Bukhari alone** | In Sahih al-Bukhari only |
| **3. Muslim alone** | In Sahih Muslim only |
| **4. On their conditions** | Meets their criteria but not in their books |
| **5. Other Sahih** | In Sunan with valid chain |

## 📚 The Hasan Hadith (الحديث الحسن)

### 🔷 Definition

> **الحسن**: A hadith with continuous chain, transmitted by a narrator of probity but whose precision is slightly less, without anomaly or defect.

### 📊 Difference from Sahih

| Criterion | Sahih | Hasan |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **'Adalah (Probity)** | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete |
| **Dabt (Precision)** | ✅ Full | ⚠️ Light |

### 🔷 Types of Hasan

| Type | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **Hasan li-Dhatihi** | Good by itself (slightly weak narrator) |
| **Hasan li-Ghayrihi** | Weak but strengthened by other routes |

## 📚 The Da'if Hadith (الحديث الضعيف)

### 🔷 Definition

> **الضعيف**: A hadith that doesn't meet the conditions of Sahih or Hasan.

### 📊 Causes of Weakness

| **Criticized narrator** | Liar, weak memory, unknown |
| **Anomaly** | Contradicts more reliable |
| **Hidden defect** | Subtle error detected by experts |

### 🔷 Degrees of Weakness

| Liar in the chain | Known lying narrator |
