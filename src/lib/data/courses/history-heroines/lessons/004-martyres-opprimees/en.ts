# The First Martyrs رضي الله عنهن — Faith Stronger Than Torture

> **"Patience, O family of Yāsir! Your appointment is in Paradise."**
> — *The Prophet ﷺ to the martyrs of Mecca*

## Introduction: The Price of Faith

In the early years of Islam, the most **vulnerable** converts — slaves, freedmen, unprotected women — paid the heaviest price. Among them, extraordinary women chose **death** rather than apostasy. Their blood founded the bases of our religion.

### Context: Meccan Persecution

| Period | Situation |
|--------|-----------|
| **1-3 before Hijra** | Individual persecution |
| **4-6 before Hijra** | Systematic torture |
| **7-10 before Hijra** | Banū Hāshim boycott |
| **11-13 before Hijra** | Intensification, emigration |

Quraysh particularly targeted:
- **Slaves** (no tribal protection)
- **Freedmen** (low social status)
- **Lone women** (vulnerable)
- **Youth** (without influence)
