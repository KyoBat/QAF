## Introduction: What are the Shamā'il?

The term **Shamā'il** (شمائل) refers to the **qualities**, **characteristics**, and **daily habits** of the Prophet ﷺ. This science, known as "'Ilm al-Shamā'il," was codified by Imam al-Tirmidhī (d. 279 H) in his famous work *Al-Shamā'il al-Muḥammadiyya*.

### Why Study the Shamā'il?

1. **Love of the Prophet** — Knowing his habits intensifies our attachment
2. **Ittibā' (Following)** — Imitating his daily life is an act of worship
3. **Uswa Ḥasana** — He is our "beautiful example" (Surah 33:21)
4. **Humanize without diminishing** — See his greatness in the details
