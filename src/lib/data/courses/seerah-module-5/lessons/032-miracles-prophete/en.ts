## Introduction: Definition of Miracle (المعجزة)

A miracle (*mu'jiza*) is a **supernatural event** granted by Allah to His prophets as proof of their truthfulness. The Arabic term "mu'jiza" derives from "'ajz" (incapacity), because a miracle **renders the opponent incapable of reproducing it**.

### Important Distinctions

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Mu'jiza** (معجزة) | Miracle of a prophet | Splitting of the moon |
| **Karāma** (كرامة) | Marvel of a saint (walī) | Extraordinary events of the Companions |
| **Istidrāj** (استدراج) | Marvel of perdition | Miracles given to disbelievers as a test |

## I. The Eternal Miracle: The Quran

### The Greatest Miracle

The Quran is the **permanent miracle** of the Prophet ﷺ, unlike the temporary miracles of previous prophets.

> **Hadith**: "*Every prophet was given miracles that caused people to believe in him. What I have been given is Revelation that Allah inspired to me. I hope therefore to have the greatest number of followers on the Day of Resurrection.*"
> — *Reported by Al-Bukhārī (4981) and Muslim (152)*

### The Quranic Challenges (التحدي)

The Quran issued **progressive challenges** to humanity:

1. **Produce a similar book** (52:34) — Impossible
2. **Produce 10 surahs** (11:13) — Impossible
3. **Produce a single surah** (2:23) — Impossible

> **"And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our servant, then produce a surah the like thereof."**
> — *Surah Al-Baqara, 2:23*

### Miraculous Aspects of the Quran

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Linguistic** (إعجاز لغوي) | Inimitable style, perfect eloquence |
| **Scientific** (إعجاز علمي) | Scientific facts before their discovery |
| **Legislative** (إعجاز تشريعي) | Perfect laws for every era |
| **Numerical** (إعجاز عددي) | Astonishing numerical coherences |
| **Preservation** (حفظه) | Unchanged for 1400 years |

Then he called all the people of the Trench: they were a thousand! All ate their fill, yet the pot kept boiling and the dough kept producing bread.*"

He was cured as if he had never been ill. 'Alī said: 'I will fight them until they become like us.' The Prophet replied: 'Proceed gently...'*"

By Allah, if I see him, I will step on his neck!*" They said: "*He is there.*" When he approached, he suddenly retreated and said: "*Between him and me is a trench of fire, wings, and terrors!*" The Prophet ﷺ said: "*If he had approached, the angels would have seized him limb by limb.*"
> — *Reported by Muslim (2797)*

## V. Wisdom Behind Different Miracles

### Why Different Miracles for Different Prophets?

| Prophet | Main Miracle | Reason |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Mūsā** | Staff, white hand | Egypt excelled in magic |
| **'Īsā** | Healing, raising the dead | Greece excelled in medicine |
| **Muḥammad** | Quran (perfect eloquence) | Arabs excelled in poetry |

---

### Permanent vs Temporary Miracle

> **Imam al-Khaṭṭābī** said: "*The miracles of previous prophets were limited to their time. The witnesses died and only narrations remain. As for the Quran, it is present, tangible, readable, recited. Its miracle is eternal.*"

---

## VI. Response to Skeptics

### Question: Why didn't the Prophet perform more visible miracles?

**Answer**:

1. **He performed dozens**, witnessed by hundreds and transmitted through continuous chains.

2. **The Quraysh weren't seeking proof, but pretexts**:

> **"Even if We sent down angels to them, and the dead spoke to them, and We gathered everything before them, they would not believe."**
> — *Surah Al-An'ām, 6:111*

3. **The permanent miracle (Quran) is more powerful** than temporary miracles.

## Conclusion: The Legacy of Miracles

The miracles of the Prophet ﷺ are not mere wonders: they are **proofs** (*āyāt*) for humanity, confirming his mission and authenticating the Quran.

The greatest miracle remains the **Quran itself**: a book revealed to an illiterate man, unchanged for 1400 years, memorized by millions, source of the greatest civilization.

> **"Say: If mankind and jinn gathered to produce something like this Quran, they could not produce its like, even if they supported one another."**
> — *Surah Al-Isrā', 17:88*
