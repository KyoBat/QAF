  content: `# 🛡️ Response to Allegations Against the Prophet ﷺ — الرَّدُّ على الشُّبُهَات

## Introduction

> "We are sufficient for you against the mockers."
> 
> — **Surah Al-Hijr (15:95)**

In our era, the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ faces unprecedented media, academic, and popular attacks. These allegations (شُبُهَات — *shubuhāt*), often repeated without verification, trouble Muslims and distort the image of Islam.

Qadi 'Iyad (may Allah have mercy on him) dedicated his masterpiece *ash-Shifā bi-Ta'rīf Ḥuqūq al-Muṣṭafā* (The Healing Through the Knowledge of the Rights of the Chosen One) to defending prophetic honor. He said: "Defending the Prophet ﷺ is an obligation upon every Muslim according to their capacity."

**Our approach**: Academic, sourced, dispassionate. We cite both Islamic sources AND contemporary historical studies to respond comprehensively.

## ⚠️ Methodological Preamble

### Golden Rules for Responding to Allegations

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Historical context** | Judge the 7th century by 7th century standards |
| **Primary sources** | Return to original texts, not hostile interpretations |
| **Consistency** | Apply the same standards to all historical figures |
| **Objectivity** | Acknowledge legitimate points of divergence |
| **Serenity** | Respond with knowledge, not emotion |

### Quote from Imam Ibn Taymiyya

> "Truth is an impregnable fortress. It needs no lies for its defense, nor violence to impose itself."
> 
> — **Ibn Taymiyya, Majmū' al-Fatāwā**

## 📚 1. The Marriage to 'Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her)

### 1.1 The Allegation

> "Muhammad married a 6/9-year-old child. That's pedophilia."

### 1.2 Contextual and Historical Analysis

#### A. 7th Century Norms

Early marriage was the **universal norm** until the 20th century:

| Era/Region | Typical Marriage Age | Examples |
|------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Medieval Europe** | 12-14 years | Margaret Beaufort (12 years, mother of Henry VII) |
| **England** | 12 years (girls), 14 years (boys) | Common Law until 1929 |
| **Ancient Rome** | 12 years (girls) | Roman Law |
| **Ancient Greece** | 12-14 years | Attested practice |
| **Traditional India** | Before puberty | Millennial practice |
| **Colonial America** | 12-13 years | Delaware: 7 years until 1970 |

**Conclusion**: Accusing the Prophet ﷺ of pedophilia amounts to accusing **all of pre-modern humanity**.

#### B. Puberty as the Criterion

In **all** ancient civilizations, marriage was permitted upon puberty. Puberty marked the transition to adulthood.

**Historian Will Durant** (non-Muslim) wrote:
> "Early marriage was universal in the ancient world. Judging the ancients by our modern standards is a historical anachronism."
> 
> — *The Story of Civilization*

#### C. 'Aisha Herself

'Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) **never** expressed trauma. On the contrary:
- She described her happy childhood with the Prophet ﷺ
- She played with her dolls and friends at his home
- She became the greatest female scholar in Islam, transmitting 2,210 hadiths
- She lived 48 years after his death, honoring his memory

**'Aisha narrated**:
> "The Prophet ﷺ would come to me while I was playing with my friends. They would hide from him, but he would call them back to play with me."
> 
> — **Sahih al-Bukhari (6130)**

#### D. No Criticism at the Time

The **enemies of the Prophet ﷺ** (Quraysh, hypocrites, Jews of Medina) accused him of everything:
- Madman (مَجْنُون)
- Poet (شَاعِر)
- Sorcerer (سَاحِر)
- Liar (كَذَّاب)

They **never** criticized this marriage. Why? Because it was **perfectly normal** in their context.

#### E. The Exact Age: Academic Debate

Contemporary Muslim researchers (such as Egyptian historian **Akram Diya' al-'Umari**) have questioned the traditional age:
- Some calculations suggest 14-16 years
- Based on comparison with Asma's age ('Aisha's sister)
- The consensus remains 9 years for consummation

**Important**: Even if the age was 9, this still conforms to the era's norms.

### 1.3 Summary Response

| Point | Response |
|-------|----------|
| **Historical norm** | Universal practice until the 20th century |
| **Criterion** | Puberty = adulthood in all ancient civilizations |
| **'Aisha's testimony** | No trauma, flourishing life, greatest female scholar |
| **Contemporary critics** | No enemy of the era criticized this marriage |
| **Anachronism** | Judging the past by present standards is fallacious |

## ⚔️ 2. Wars and Violence

### 2.1 The Allegation

> "Islam spread by the sword. Muhammad was a violent warrior."

### 2.2 Factual Analysis

#### A. Legitimate Defense

The first battles were **defensive**:

| Battle | Date | Context | Initiative |
|--------|------|---------|------------|
| **Badr** | 2 AH | Quraysh came to destroy Medina | Defense |
| **Uhud** | 3 AH | Quraysh came for revenge | Defense |
| **Khandaq** | 5 AH | Coalition of 10,000 to annihilate Muslims | Defense |

For **13 years** in Mecca, Muslims endured:
- Torture (Bilal, Sumayyah, Yasir)
- Boycott (3 years in the ravine)
- Assassinations (Sumayyah = first martyr)
- Expulsion from their homes

They **never** retaliated with violence. Only in Medina, after establishing a state, did Allah permit defense:

> "Permission has been given to those who are being fought, because they were wronged. And indeed, Allah is competent to give them victory."
> 
> — **Surah Al-Hajj (22:39)**

#### B. Ethical Rules of War

The Prophet ﷺ established **revolutionary** rules for his time:

> "Go forth in the name of Allah... Do not kill a child, nor an elderly person, nor a woman. Do not cut down a fruit-bearing tree. Do not destroy a building. Do not slaughter a sheep or camel except for food. Do not drown palm trees. Do not betray. Do not mutilate."
> 
> — **Reported by Malik in al-Muwatta' and al-Bayhaqi**

**Comparison**:

| Aspect | Practice of the Era | Prophetic Rules |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Civilians** | Massacred | Protected |
| **Trees** | Burned (scorched earth) | Cutting prohibited |
| **Prisoners** | Executed or enslaved | Released, ransomed, or converted |
| **Female captives** | Raped | Married or freed |
| **Places of worship** | Destroyed | Protected |

#### C. The Human Toll

Over **23 years** of prophetic mission:
- Total number of battles: approximately 27
- **Total casualties (all sides)**: ~1,000 people (high estimate)

**Historical comparison**:
- Crusades: 1-3 million dead
- Inquisition: 30,000 - 300,000 dead
- Conquest of the Americas: 50-100 million dead
- World War I: 17 million dead

The Prophet ﷺ accomplished a **civilizational revolution** with minimal violence.

#### D. The Conquest of Mecca

The supreme example of his mercy: the Conquest of Mecca (630 CE).

- **10,000 soldiers** enter without combat
- **General amnesty** for everyone, including his worst enemies
- **"Go, you are free"** (إذهبوا فأنتم الطُّلَقَاء)
- Hind, who had mutilated Hamza's body, was pardoned
- Abu Sufyan, opposition leader, was pardoned

**French historian Gustave Le Bon** wrote:
> "If we were to judge the value of men by the greatness of the works they founded, we could say that Mohammed was one of the greatest men history has known."
> 
> — *The Civilization of the Arabs* (1884)

### 2.3 Summary Response

| Point | Response |
|-------|----------|
| **Context** | 13 years of passive persecution before any retaliation |
| **Nature of battles** | Defensive in their vast majority |
| **Ethical rules** | Revolutionary for the era (protection of civilians, trees, prisoners) |
| **Human toll** | ~1,000 deaths in 23 years (minimal for a world revolution) |
| **Conquest of Mecca** | General amnesty = model of clemency |

## ⛓️ 3. Slavery

### 3.1 The Allegation

> "Islam permits slavery. Muhammad owned slaves."

### 3.2 Historical and Legal Analysis

#### A. The Global Context

Slavery existed in **all** civilizations throughout history:
- Ancient Greece (Aristotle justified it philosophically)
- Ancient Rome (up to 40% of the population)
- Pre-Islamic Africa
- The Americas (until the 19th century)
- Medieval Europe (serfdom)

**Islam arrived in a slaveholding world**.

#### B. The Strategy of Gradual Abolition

Islam did not abolish slavery overnight (which would have caused economic and social chaos) but implemented a **strategy of gradual abolition**:

**1. Closing sources of new slaves**:
- Prohibition of debt slavery
- Prohibition of enslaving a free person
- Only prisoners of war (alternative to execution)

**2. Widely opening doors of liberation**:
- Manumission = expiation for many sins (Quran 5:89, 58:3)
- Manumission = one of the 8 categories of Zakat (Quran 9:60)
- Contract of gradual liberation (مُكَاتَبَة — mukātaba)
- Manumission of the mother of a child born to the master (أُمّ وَلَد)

**3. Radical improvement of their condition**:
> "Your slaves are your brothers. Allah has placed them under your authority. Whoever has his brother under his authority should feed him from what he eats and clothe him from what he wears. Do not burden them with tasks beyond their capacity, and if you do, help them."
> 
> — **Sahih al-Bukhari (30) and Muslim (1661)**

#### C. The Prophet's Example

The Prophet ﷺ **freed all the slaves** he owned or was gifted:
- **Zayd ibn Haritha**: Freed, adopted as son, army general
- **Bilal ibn Rabah**: Freed by Abu Bakr, first muezzin, honored among companions
- **Maria the Copt**: Mother of his son Ibrahim, elevated to Mother of the Believers

**Hadith**:
> "Free a slave, and Allah will free each limb of your body from the Fire, limb by limb."
> 
> — **Sahih Muslim (1509)**

#### D. Comparison with the West

| Aspect | Islam (7th century) | West (until 19th century) |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Source** | Prisoners of war only | Raids, debts, birth |
| **Treatment** | "Your brothers" | Cattle, Black Codes |
| **Liberation** | Encouraged, rewarded | Discouraged, punished |
| **Marriage** | Allowed with free persons | Prohibited |
| **Education** | Encouraged | Prohibited |

**British historian Arnold Toynbee**:
> "The extinction of race discrimination among Muslims is one of the outstanding moral achievements of Islam."
> 
> — *Civilization on Trial* (1948)

### 3.3 Summary Response

| Point | Response |
|-------|----------|
| **Context** | Slavery was universal; Islam inherited it |
| **Strategy** | Gradual abolition: drying up sources + massive liberation |
| **Slaves' condition** | Revolutionary: "your brothers," fed/clothed like you |
| **Prophetic example** | Freed all his slaves, elevated Bilal and Zayd |
| **Comparison** | The West practiced far more brutal slavery until the 19th century |

## 👰 4. Polygamy

### 4.1 The Allegation

> "Muhammad had 11 wives. Islam encourages male lust."

### 4.2 Contextual Analysis

#### A. Polygamy in History

Polygamy was practiced by:
- Biblical prophets (Abraham, Jacob, David, Solomon)
- Kings and nobles of all civilizations
- African, Asian, and Native American societies

**Solomon** (peace be upon him) according to the Bible: 700 wives and 300 concubines (1 Kings 11:3).

#### B. Islamic Regulation

Islam **limited and regulated** an unlimited practice:

> "Marry those that please you of women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then only one."
> 
> — **Surah An-Nisa (4:3)**

**Conditions**:
1. Maximum of 4 (previously: unlimited)
2. Justice between them is mandatory
3. Financial capability
4. Possible stipulation in the marriage contract

#### C. The Prophet's Marriages

We addressed this topic in detail in the lesson on the Wives. Recall:

| Wisdom | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| **Political alliances** | 'Aisha (Abu Bakr), Hafsa ('Umar), Umm Habiba (Abu Sufyan) |
| **Widow protection** | Sawdah, Umm Salamah, Zaynab bint Khuzaymah |
| **Reconciliation** | Juwayriyah (100 families freed), Safiyyah (Jews) |
| **Legislation** | Zaynab bint Jahsh (abolition of pre-Islamic adoption) |
| **Knowledge transmission** | 'Aisha (2,210 hadiths) |

**If the Prophet ﷺ had been motivated by desire**:
- Why marry Sawdah, a 55-year-old widow?
- Why marry Zaynab bint Khuzaymah, who died 2 months later?
- Why remain monogamous for 25 years with Khadijah (older than him)?

#### D. The Prophet's Special Case

The Prophet ﷺ had a **divine dispensation** to exceed 4 wives:

> "O Prophet, We have made lawful to you your wives..."
> 
> — **Surah Al-Ahzab (33:50)**

But this dispensation came with **severe restrictions**:
- Prohibition of divorcing his wives (33:52)
- His wives could not remarry after him (33:53)
- Their status as "Mothers of the Believers" entailed special duties

### 4.3 Summary Response

| Point | Response |
|-------|----------|
| **Context** | Universal polygamy; Islam limited and regulated it |
| **Limit** | Maximum 4 (previously: unlimited) with justice condition |
| **Prophet's marriages** | Political, humanitarian, legislative, educational wisdoms |
| **Counter-argument** | 25 years monogamous with Khadijah; elderly/widowed wives |

## 🔮 5. Alleged Quranic Violence

### 5.1 The Allegation

> "The Quran contains violent verses calling to kill non-Muslims."

### 5.2 Exegetical Analysis

#### A. The Most Cited Verse (9:5)

> "Kill the polytheists wherever you find them..."

**COMPLETE context**:

This verse is part of a sequence (9:1-14) concerning a **specific treaty** broken by the Meccan polytheists. Let's read the following verse (9:6):

> "And if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that he may hear the words of Allah. Then deliver him to his place of safety."
> 
> — **Surah At-Tawba (9:6)**

**And the preceding context (9:4)**:
> "Except those of the polytheists with whom you made a treaty and who have not failed you in anything and have not supported anyone against you. So complete for them their treaty until their term."

**Conclusion**: This verse concerns a **specific** group that had betrayed a treaty, in a state of war. It does not apply to non-Muslims in general.

#### B. Verses of Tolerance

The Quran contains dozens of tolerance verses:

> "There is no compulsion in religion."
> — **Surah Al-Baqara (2:256)**

> "For you is your religion, and for me is my religion."
> — **Surah Al-Kafirun (109:6)**

> "And if your Lord had willed, those on earth would have believed - all of them entirely. Then would you compel the people in order that they become believers?"
> — **Surah Yunus (10:99)**

> "Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best."
> — **Surah An-Nahl (16:125)**

#### C. The Rule of Interpretation

Muslim scholars have always applied the rule of **contextualization** (أسباب النزول — *asbāb an-nuzūl*):
- Each verse has a **context of revelation**
- War verses concern **war situations**
- Peace verses concern **normal situations**

**Imam ash-Shafi'i** (may Allah have mercy on him):
> "Whoever interprets the Quran without knowing the Arabic language, the circumstances of revelation, and the sciences of exegesis, goes astray and leads others astray."

### 5.3 Summary Response

| Point | Response |
|-------|----------|
| **"Violent" verses** | Concern specific war situations, after betrayal |
| **Context** | Always read preceding and following verses |
| **Tolerance verses** | "No compulsion"; "For you your religion"; "with wisdom" |
| **Methodology** | Scholars have contextualized for 14 centuries |
