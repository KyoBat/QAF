## 🎬 Introduction

These two sects represent one of the greatest trials the Ummah has faced in its creed. The **Jahmiyyah** denied Allah's Attributes, and the **Mu'tazilah** made **human reason** the supreme judge over Revelation.

The trial of the **"Creation of the Quran"** remains etched in history: the Abbasid caliphs tortured and imprisoned scholars to force them to accept this heresy. Only Imam Ahmad's steadfastness saved the creed of the Ummah.

## 📜 Part 1: The Jahmiyyah — Negators of the Attributes

### The Founder: Jahm ibn Safwan

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 SCENE: The Origin of Negation — Transoxiana, ~120 H**

*Jahm ibn Safwan debates with Indian philosophers (the Sumaniyyah).*

**Indian philosopher**: "Describe your God to me. Have you seen Him? Touched Him? Smelled Him?"

**Jahm**: "No..."

**Philosopher**: "Then you cannot prove His existence!"

*Jahm was left speechless. He secluded himself for forty days, then returned with a new doctrine...*

**Jahm** *(after reflection)*: "For Allah not to resemble anything, I must **negate** everything that describes Him! No Attributes, no resemblance!"

*Thus was born the negation of Allah's Attributes.*

</div>

### The Four Deviations of the Jahmiyyah

| Deviation | Detail | Consequence |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **1. Negation of Names and Attributes** | Allah has no Hand, no Face, no Speech | Allah becomes an abstract void |
| **2. Creation of the Quran** | The Quran is not Allah's true Speech | Allah never spoke |
| **3. Determinism (Jabr)** | Man has no choice whatsoever | Nullification of responsibility |
| **4. Extreme Murji'ism** | Faith = knowledge alone | Pharaoh would be a "believer"! |

### Al-Ta'til: Stripping Allah of All Attributes

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 SCENE: The Absurdity of Ta'til**

**Sunni**: "According to you, Allah has no Hand, no Face, no Speech?"

**Jahmi**: "Correct. Otherwise, He would resemble the creatures."

**Sunni**: "So Allah does not exist?"

**Jahmi**: "Yes He does! But we cannot say anything about Him."

**Sunni**: "Can you describe something that has no attributes? Even nothingness has attributes (non-existence)! You have described Allah in a way worse than nothingness!"

**Jahmi** *(silent)*: "..."

</div>

### The End of Jahm ibn Safwan

<div class="quote-box">

**Jahm ibn Safwan was killed in 128 H** by Salm ibn Ahwaz, the Umayyad governor of Khurasan.

The scholars of the Salaf considered the **extreme Jahmiyyah as disbelievers**:

**Imam Ahmad**: "Whoever says the Quran is created is a **kafir** (disbeliever)."

**Imam al-Bukhari**: "I look at the Jahmiyyah the way I look at the Jews and Christians."

</div>

## ⚔️ Part 2: The Mu'tazilah — Reason Above Revelation

### The Origin of the Name

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 SCENE: The Separation — Circle of al-Hasan al-Basri, Basra, ~110 H**

*Al-Hasan al-Basri رحمه الله is teaching. A man poses a question.*

**The man**: "O Imam, what do you say about one who commits a major sin? Is he a believer or a disbeliever?"

*Before al-Hasan could answer, Wasil ibn 'Ata' steps forward.*

**Wasil ibn 'Ata'**: "He is neither a believer nor a disbeliever! He is in an **intermediate position** between the two!"

*Wasil withdraws from the circle and forms his own group.*

**Al-Hasan al-Basri**: "قد اعتزلنا واصل" — "Wasil has separated (i'tazala) from us."

*Hence the name: **Mu'tazilah** (those who separated).*

</div>

### The Five Founding Principles of the Mu'tazilah

\`\`\`
The Five Principles (الأصول الخمسة)
├── 1️⃣ TAWHID (their version)
│   ├── Negation of essential Attributes
│   ├── "Affirming Attributes = plurality of eternals"
│   └── → Allah hears, but has no Hearing!
│
├── 2️⃣ JUSTICE (their version)
│   ├── Man creates his own actions
│   ├── Allah cannot create evil
│   └── → Negation of Divine Decree (like the Qadariyyah)
│
├── 3️⃣ THE INTERMEDIATE POSITION
│   ├── The major sinner ≠ believer
│   ├── The major sinner ≠ disbeliever
│   └── → He is "between the two" (manzilah bayna manzilatay)
│
├── 4️⃣ EXECUTION OF THE THREAT
│   ├── Whoever enters Hell never leaves
│   ├── No intercession for major sinners
│   └── → Despair for sinful Muslims
│
└── 5️⃣ COMMANDING GOOD AND FORBIDDING EVIL
    ├── By force and sword if possible
    ├── Rebellion against the unjust ruler = obligatory
    └── → Chaos and civil wars
\`\`\`

## 🔥 Part 3: The Trial of the Creation of the Quran (al-Mihna)

### The Context

In 218 H, the Abbasid caliph **al-Ma'mun** adopted the Mu'tazilite dogma that **the Quran is created**. He ordered the scholars to be put to trial (mihna) and forced to profess this doctrine.

### The Trial of Imam Ahmad

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 SCENE: The Interrogation — The Caliph's Palace, 218 H**

*Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal رحمه الله is brought in chains before the caliph.*

**The caliph (by letter)**: "Is the Quran created or not?"

**Imam Ahmad**: "The Quran is the Speech of Allah. It is not created."

**The Mu'tazilite judge**: "Say: 'The Quran is created!' and you will be released!"

**Imam Ahmad**: "Give me a verse or a hadith that says this, and I will say it."

**The judge**: "We judge by reason! The Quran consists of letters and sounds, and everything that is letters and sounds is created!"

**Imam Ahmad**: "I only say what Allah and His Prophet ﷺ have said."

*They whipped him until he fainted. He did not yield.*

</div>

### The Legendary Steadfastness

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 SCENE: The Prison — Baghdad, 218-220 H**

*Imam Ahmad has been in prison for months. A man visits him.*

**The man**: "O Abu 'Abdullah, give yourself rest! Say it with your tongue while your heart remains at peace!"

**Imam Ahmad**: "If the scholar answers through dissimulation and the ignorant through ignorance, **when then will the truth be made manifest**?"

*Another person tells him:*

**Another visitor**: "The caliphs and judges have all said the Quran is created. Can we not follow the consensus?"

**Imam Ahmad**: "**How would the heavens and earth remain standing** if the scholars say what the rulers want to hear?"

</div>

### The Timeline of the Trial

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| **218 H** | Al-Ma'mun imposes the dogma, writes to the governors |
| **218 H** | Death of al-Ma'mun, al-Mu'tasim continues the trial |
| **220 H** | Imam Ahmad is released but kept under surveillance |
| **227 H** | Al-Wathiq continues the persecution |
| **232 H** | **Al-Mutawakkil** ends the trial and restores the Sunnah |

<div class="quote-box">

**Imam Ahmad said:**

**« سبحانك هذا بهتان عظيم! كيف أقول ما لم يقله الله ولا رسوله ﷺ! »**

**"Glory be to You! This is a tremendous slander! How could I say what Allah and His Messenger ﷺ did not say!"**

</div>

## ⚖️ Part 4: Comparison and Refutation

### Comparative Table

| Issue | Jahmiyyah | Mu'tazilah | Ahl as-Sunnah |
|-------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **Allah's Attributes** | ❌ Total negation | ❌ Partial negation | ✅ Affirmation without resemblance |
| **The Quran** | ❌ Created | ❌ Created | ✅ Allah's Speech, uncreated |
| **Divine Decree** | ⚠️ Determinism (Jabr) | ❌ Negation (Qadar) | ✅ Affirmation with human choice |
| **Faith** | ⚠️ Knowledge alone | ⚠️ Belief + actions (no distinction) | ✅ Belief + speech + actions |
| **Major sinner** | ⚠️ Perfect believer | ❌ Neither believer nor kafir, eternal in Hell | ✅ Imperfect believer, under Allah's will |
| **Seeing Allah** | ❌ Impossible | ❌ Impossible | ✅ Believers will see Allah |

### Refutation of the Negation of Attributes

| Their argument | Response |
|----------------|----------|
| "Affirming Attributes = resemblance" | ﴿لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ﴾ — He affirmed Hearing and Sight **after** negating resemblance |
| "Affirming = plurality of eternals" | The Attributes are not separate entities |
| "Reason negates the Attributes" | Sound reason does not contradict Revelation |

### Refutation of "The Creation of the Quran"

<div class="quote-box">

**The proof:**

﴿ أَلَا لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالْأَمْرُ ﴾

**"Indeed, to Him belongs the creation AND the command."** [Al-A'raf: 54]

Allah **distinguished** between creation (al-khalq) and command (al-amr). The Quran is a command, not a creation.

## 📖 Part 5: The Regret of the Mutakallimun

### Ahmad's Steadfastness and the Salvation of the Ummah

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 SCENE: After the Trial — Baghdad, After 232 H**

*Imam Ahmad, aged and marked by the whips, is teaching.*

**A student**: "O Imam, why did you endure all of that? You could have practiced dissimulation (taqiyyah)!"

**Imam Ahmad**: "If I had yielded, people would have said: 'Imam Ahmad said the Quran is created!' And this statement would have become the creed for future generations. I preferred to suffer myself rather than make the creed of the Ummah suffer."

**Another student**: "Were you not afraid of death?"

**Imam Ahmad**: "I was afraid of **meeting Allah** having said what He did not say."

</div>

<div class="quote-box">

**'Ali ibn al-Madini said:**

**« إن الله أعز هذا الدين برجلين: أبي بكر يوم الردة، وأحمد يوم المحنة »**

**"Allah honored this religion through two men: Abu Bakr on the day of apostasy, and Ahmad on the day of the trial."**

</div>

### The Regret of Imam ar-Razi

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 SCENE: The Deathbed — Ray, 606 H**

*Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi, the great theologian and philosopher, lies on his deathbed. His students surround him.*

**Ar-Razi** *(weakly)*: "I have explored all the methods of speculative theology and all the paths of philosophy..."

**Student**: "And what did you find, O Imam?"

**Ar-Razi**: "I found nothing that quenches the thirst or heals the ailment. I found the closest path to be the path of the Quran."

**Student**: "What do you mean?"

**Ar-Razi**: "I mean: read in affirmation ﴿الرَّحْمَٰنُ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ اسْتَوَىٰ﴾ (The Most Merciful established Himself over the Throne), and read in negation ﴿لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ﴾ (There is nothing like unto Him). Whoever has tried what I have tried knows what I know."

</div>

### The Regret of Imam al-Juwayni

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 SCENE: The Last Gathering — Nishapur, 478 H**

*Imam al-Haramayn al-Juwayni, the great Ash'ari scholar, gathers his students.*

**Al-Juwayni**: "O my companions! Do not occupy yourselves with speculative theology. Had I known it would lead me to what it has, I would not have engaged in it."

**Student**: "But you are the Imam of the two Holy Sanctuaries!"

**Al-Juwayni** *(with tears)*: "I am dying upon the creed of my mother... the creed of the old women of Nishapur... I am dying upon the natural disposition (fitrah)."

</div>

<div class="quote-box">

**Imam ash-Shahrastani (d. 548 H) said:**

**« لقد تأملت الطرق الكلامية والمناهج الفلسفية فما رأيتها تشفي عليلا ولا تروي غليلا »**

**"I have examined the theological methods and philosophical approaches, and I did not see them heal the sick or quench the thirsty."**

</div>

## 🎯 Part 6: Contemporary Case Studies

### Case 1: Allegorical Interpretation of the Attributes

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 SCENE: The Theology Class — Today**

**Professor**: "When Allah says 'يَدُ اللَّهِ' (the Hand of Allah), it means 'power.' And 'اسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ' (He established Himself over the Throne) means 'He dominated.'"

**Student**: "But the Salaf did not interpret it that way!"

**Professor**: "The Salaf were simple. We understand better through philosophy."

**Student**: "Imam Malik said: 'Al-Istiwa is known, the how is unknown, belief in it is obligatory, and asking about it is an innovation.' Why interpret it otherwise?"

</div>

**Rule**: ✅ The methodology of the Salaf: **affirm** the Attributes without interpreting, denying, detailing, or likening them.

---

### Case 2: "Reason Judges the Text"

**Situation**: A philosopher says: "If a text contradicts reason, we reject it or reinterpret it!"

| Response |
|----------|
| 1. **Sound** reason never contradicts **authentic** Revelation |
| 2. If there appears to be contradiction, it is either **faulty reasoning** or a **misunderstood text** |
| 3. Ibn Taymiyyah refuted this in "Dar' Ta'arud al-'Aql wa an-Naql" (11 volumes) |
| 4. Revelation is **certain**, reason can err |

---

### Case 3: The Vision of Allah

**Situation**: Someone says: "It is impossible to see Allah, because vision implies He is in a direction, therefore limited!"

<div class="quote-box">

**The proof from the Quran:**

﴿ وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ نَّاضِرَةٌ ۞ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهَا نَاظِرَةٌ ﴾

**"Faces that Day will be radiant, looking at their Lord."** [Al-Qiyamah: 22-23]

**The proof from the Sunnah:**

**« إنكم سترون ربكم كما ترون القمر ليلة البدر »**

**"You will see your Lord as you see the moon on the night of the full moon."** [Al-Bukhari 554, Muslim 633]

</div>

**Rule**: ✅ Seeing Allah in Paradise is established by **mutawatir texts**. The Mu'tazilah denied it following their corrupt principles.

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

### The Lesson of the Trial

\`\`\`
What does Imam Ahmad's Trial teach us?
├── 1️⃣ The truth can be in the minority
│   └── Ahmad stood alone against caliphs and judges
│
├── 2️⃣ The scholar must stand firm
│   └── "If the scholar practices dissimulation..."
│
├── 3️⃣ The consequences extend beyond the individual
│   └── What Ahmad says affects the entire Ummah
│
└── 4️⃣ Allah preserves His religion
    └── The trial ended, the Sunnah triumphed
\`\`\`

### Personal Questions

- Do you place your reason above the texts?
- Do you know the creed of the Salaf regarding the Attributes?
- Would you have stood firm like Imam Ahmad?
