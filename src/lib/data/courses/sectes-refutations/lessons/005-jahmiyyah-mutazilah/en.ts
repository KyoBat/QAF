## Introduction: The Emergence of Speculative Theology

### What is 'Ilm al-Kalam?
Speculative theology is a science that studies Islamic beliefs through rational and philosophical proofs. It emerged due to:
1. The translation of Greek philosophy
2. Debates with deviant sects
3. Departure from the methodology of the Salaf in receiving creed

## First Sect: The Jahmiyyah

### Definition and Origin
- **Founder**: Jahm ibn Safwan (d. 128H)
- **Received his ideas from**: Al-Ja'd ibn Dirham
- **His death**: Killed by Salm ibn Ahwaz, the Umayyad governor

### The Foundations of Jahmite Belief

#### 1. Negation of Names and Attributes
| Their Position | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Names | Allah has no real names |
| Attributes | Denial of all attributes |
| Argument | To avoid resembling creation |

#### 2. The Creation of the Quran
- The Quran is created and is not Allah's true speech
- This is the thesis for which Imam Ahmad رحمه الله was tested

#### 3. Determinism (Jabr)
- The servant is compelled, without choice
- Like a feather in the wind

#### 4. Extreme Murji'ism
- Faith is only knowledge
- Pharaoh was a believer because he knew Allah!

### Refutation of the Jahmiyyah

Among the greatest works written against them:
- **"Ar-Radd 'ala al-Jahmiyyah"** by Imam Ahmad
- **"Khalq Af'al al-'Ibad"** by al-Bukhari
- **"Al-Ibanah"** by Ibn Battah

## Second Sect: The Mu'tazilah

### Definition and Origin
- **Founder**: Wasil ibn 'Ata' (d. 131H)
- **Reason for the name**: He "withdrew" (i'tazala) from the circle of al-Hasan al-Basri when he disagreed with him on the issue of the one who commits major sins
- **Origin**: Basra in the early second century

### The Five Principles of the Mu'tazilah

#### 1. Tawhid (according to their understanding)
- Denial of Allah's essential attributes
- They call themselves "the people of Tawhid"
- They say: affirming attributes implies multiple eternals!

#### 2. Justice (according to their understanding)
- Denial of predestination
- Allah does not create the servants' actions
- The servant creates his own action

#### 3. The Intermediate Position
- The one who commits major sins is neither believer nor disbeliever
- He is in a position between the two
- His status in this life: sinner (fasiq)
- His status in the Hereafter: eternal in Hell

#### 4. Execution of the Threat
- Whoever enters Hell will never leave
- No intercession for those who commit major sins

#### 5. Commanding Good and Forbidding Evil
- By force and sword if possible
- They permitted rebellion against the unjust ruler

### The Leaders of the Mu'tazilah
1. **Wasil ibn 'Ata'** (d. 131H) — The founder
2. **'Amr ibn 'Ubayd** (d. 144H)
3. **Abu al-Hudhayl al-'Allaf** (d. 235H)
4. **An-Nazzam** (d. 231H)
5. **Al-Jahiz** (d. 255H) — Litterateur and theologian
6. **Al-Qadi 'Abd al-Jabbar** (d. 415H)
7. **Az-Zamakhshari** (d. 538H) — Author of al-Kashshaf

### The Trial of the Creation of the Quran

During the reign of al-Ma'mun (218H), the caliph adopted the Mu'tazilite doctrine and tested the scholars:
- **Imam Ahmad** stood firm and endured prison and beatings
- The trial continued under al-Mu'tasim and al-Wathiq
- It ended with the accession of al-Mutawakkil (232H)

## Comparison Between Jahmiyyah and Mu'tazilah

| Issue | Jahmiyyah | Mu'tazilah |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Attributes | Total denial | Denial of essential attributes |
| Predestination | Determinism | Denial |
| Faith | Knowledge only | Belief and actions |
| Creation of Quran | Yes | Yes |
| Committer of major sin | Believer | Intermediate position |

---

## The Position of the Salaf Toward These Two Sects

### Statements of the Salaf

> Imam Ahmad said: "Whoever says the Quran is created is a disbeliever."

> Sufyan ath-Thawri said: "Whoever says the Quran is created has said a tremendous thing."

### The Ruling on Them
- The extreme Jahmiyyah: **disbelievers** according to many of the Salaf
- The Mu'tazilah: **misguided innovators**
