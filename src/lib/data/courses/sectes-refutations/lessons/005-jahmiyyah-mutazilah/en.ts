## Introduction: The Emergence of Speculative Theology

### What is 'Ilm al-Kalam?
Speculative theology is a science that studies Islamic beliefs through rational and philosophical proofs. It emerged due to:
1. The translation of Greek philosophy
2. Debates with deviant sects
3. Departure from the methodology of the Salaf in receiving creed

---

## First Sect: The Jahmiyyah

### Definition and Origin
- **Founder**: Jahm ibn Safwan (d. 128H)
- **Received his ideas from**: Al-Ja'd ibn Dirham
- **His death**: Killed by Salm ibn Ahwaz, the Umayyad governor

### The Foundations of Jahmite Belief

#### 1. Negation of Names and Attributes
| Their Position | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Names | Allah has no real names |
| Attributes | Denial of all attributes |
| Argument | To avoid resembling creation |

#### 2. The Creation of the Quran
- The Quran is created and is not Allah's true speech
- This is the thesis for which Imam Ahmad رحمه الله was tested

#### 3. Determinism (Jabr)
- The servant is compelled, without choice
- Like a feather in the wind

#### 4. Extreme Murji'ism
- Faith is only knowledge
- Pharaoh was a believer because he knew Allah!

### Refutation of the Jahmiyyah

Among the greatest works written against them:
- **"Ar-Radd 'ala al-Jahmiyyah"** by Imam Ahmad
- **"Khalq Af'al al-'Ibad"** by al-Bukhari
- **"Al-Ibanah"** by Ibn Battah

---

## Second Sect: The Mu'tazilah

### Definition and Origin
- **Founder**: Wasil ibn 'Ata' (d. 131H)
- **Reason for the name**: He "withdrew" (i'tazala) from the circle of al-Hasan al-Basri when he disagreed with him on the issue of the one who commits major sins
- **Origin**: Basra in the early second century

### The Five Principles of the Mu'tazilah

#### 1. Tawhid (according to their understanding)
- Denial of Allah's essential attributes
- They call themselves "the people of Tawhid"
- They say: affirming attributes implies multiple eternals!

#### 2. Justice (according to their understanding)
- Denial of predestination
- Allah does not create the servants' actions
- The servant creates his own action

#### 3. The Intermediate Position
- The one who commits major sins is neither believer nor disbeliever
- He is in a position between the two
- His status in this life: sinner (fasiq)
- His status in the Hereafter: eternal in Hell

#### 4. Execution of the Threat
- Whoever enters Hell will never leave
- No intercession for those who commit major sins

#### 5. Commanding Good and Forbidding Evil
- By force and sword if possible
- They permitted rebellion against the unjust ruler

### The Leaders of the Mu'tazilah
1. **Wasil ibn 'Ata'** (d. 131H) — The founder
2. **'Amr ibn 'Ubayd** (d. 144H)
3. **Abu al-Hudhayl al-'Allaf** (d. 235H)
4. **An-Nazzam** (d. 231H)
5. **Al-Jahiz** (d. 255H) — Litterateur and theologian
6. **Al-Qadi 'Abd al-Jabbar** (d. 415H)
7. **Az-Zamakhshari** (d. 538H) — Author of al-Kashshaf

### The Trial of the Creation of the Quran

During the reign of al-Ma'mun (218H), the caliph adopted the Mu'tazilite doctrine and tested the scholars:
- **Imam Ahmad** stood firm and endured prison and beatings
- The trial continued under al-Mu'tasim and al-Wathiq
- It ended with the accession of al-Mutawakkil (232H)

## Comparison Between Jahmiyyah and Mu'tazilah

| Issue | Jahmiyyah | Mu'tazilah |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Attributes | Total denial | Denial of essential attributes |
| Predestination | Determinism | Denial |
| Faith | Knowledge only | Belief and actions |
| Creation of Quran | Yes | Yes |
| Committer of major sin | Believer | Intermediate position |

## The Position of the Salaf Toward These Two Sects

### Statements of the Salaf

> Imam Ahmad said: "Whoever says the Quran is created is a disbeliever."

> Sufyan ath-Thawri said: "Whoever says the Quran is created has said a tremendous thing."

### The Ruling on Them
- The extreme Jahmiyyah: **disbelievers** according to many of the Salaf
- The Mu'tazilah: **misguided innovators**

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf: Imam Ahmad's Steadfastness During the Trial

When the Caliph al-Ma'mun adopted the Mu'tazilite doctrine of the creation of the Quran, the scholars were tested and forced to profess it. Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal رحمه الله was brought in.

He was told: *"Say: The Quran is created!"* He refused.

He was imprisoned and beaten with whips until he fainted, yet he did not budge from the truth.

Imam Ahmad said: *"If the scholar answers out of fear and the ignorant person out of ignorance, when will the truth be made clear?"*

Someone told him in prison: *"O Abu 'Abdullah, ease yourselves and say it with your tongues while your hearts are at peace!"*

Ahmad replied: *"If the scholar speaks out of fear and the ignorant out of ignorance, when will the truth appear?"*

The trial lasted eighteen months, and Imam Ahmad stood firm, becoming the cause for preserving the Sunnah.

**Lesson learned**: Steadfastness upon truth during times of trial is the greatest jihad. Had Ahmad not stood firm, the creed of the Ummah would have been lost.

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases: Effects of Mu'tazilism and Jahmism

### Case 1: Interpretation of Attributes
Someone says: *"'The Hand' in the Quran means power, and 'Istawa' means dominated, because Allah is transcendent above corporeality!"*

**Question**: Is this interpretation correct?

**Answer**: ❌ No. This is the interpretation of the Mu'tazilah and Jahmiyyah. The methodology of the Salaf: Affirming the attributes as they came without distortion or denial, without asking how or likening to creation.

---

### Case 2: Predestination and Responsibility
Someone says: *"If Allah predetermined my disobedience, why does He hold me accountable? I am compelled!"*

**Question**: Is the human being compelled in his actions?

**Answer**: ❌ No. This is the doubt of the Jabriyyah. The truth is that Allah creates everything including the servants' actions, but the servant has will, choice, and agency for which he is held accountable.

---

### Case 3: Ruling by Reason
A philosopher says: *"Reason is the primary judge, and whatever contradicts reason in the texts we reject or reinterpret!"*

**Question**: Is reason given precedence over text?

**Answer**: ❌ No. This is the foundation of Mu'tazilism. According to Ahl as-Sunnah: Sound reason does not contradict authentic revelation, and when there appears to be conflict, the text is given precedence.

---

### Case 4: Denying the Vision of Allah
Someone says: *"Allah cannot be seen on the Day of Judgment because seeing necessitates corporeality!"*

**Question**: Does Ahl as-Sunnah deny seeing Allah on the Day of Judgment?

**Answer**: ❌ No. Seeing Allah on the Day of Judgment is established by the Quran and mutawatir Sunnah. Allah تعالى says: {Faces that Day will be radiant * Looking at their Lord}. The Mu'tazilah denied it following their corrupt principles.

---

### Case 5: The Noble Quran
A student asks: *"What is the difference between our saying the Quran is Allah's Speech and the Mu'tazilite saying it is created?"*

**Question**: Why is this issue important?

**Answer**: ✅ Because saying the Quran is created implies that Allah was devoid of speech then began to speak, which is a deficiency. Ahl as-Sunnah say: The Quran is truly Allah's Speech, with which He spoke, uncreated.

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

**Personal question**: If you were in Imam Ahmad's time and faced the trial... would you have stood firm or made excuses?

**Remember:**
- Sound creed sometimes requires sacrifice to preserve it
- Do not give precedence to your mind over the texts of revelation
- Learn the creed of the Salaf from its original sources
- Beware of the theological doubts spreading today
