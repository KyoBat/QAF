## 📜 Scene 1: The Birth of an Impostor

<div class="scene-box">

**Qadian, India — 1880**

*Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, a frail man with piercing eyes, sits in his room. Outside, the British Empire controls India. Muslims are weakened after the failure of the 1857 revolt.*

**Mirza** *(writing)*: Muslims need a renewer... Someone to guide them in these difficult times.

*A few years later, his claims evolve...*

**Mirza** *(to his disciples)*: I have come to confirm that Jihad by the sword is abrogated. The British are our benefactors.

**A disciple**: But Master, the Prophet ﷺ...

**Mirza**: I am the promised Messiah! 'Isa did not ascend to heaven, he died in Kashmir! I am the Messiah who has descended!

*Later still...*

**Mirza** *(writing in his book)*: "Allah has revealed to me that I am a prophet and messenger..."

**Muslim scholars**: He is an impostor! An agent of the British!

## ⏳ The Escalation of Claims

<div class="quote-box">

**The Four Stages of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad**:

| Stage | Claim | Approximate Date |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| **1st** | Renewer (Mujaddid) and inspired | 1882 |
| **2nd** | The awaited Mahdi | 1891 |
| **3rd** | The promised Messiah ('Isa) | 1891 |
| **4th** | Prophet and messenger | 1901 |

**The lie amplifies**: From mere reformer to prophet in less than 20 years.

</div>

## ⚔️ The Foundations of Qadiani Belief

### 1. The Claim to Prophethood

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Scene 2: The Heresy Exposed**

**Dialogue between a Muslim and a Qadiani**

**Muslim**: Isn't the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ the Seal of the Prophets?

**Qadiani**: Yes, but "seal" (khatam) means the best and most beautiful, not the last!

**Muslim**: The Prophet ﷺ clearly said: "There is no prophet after me" (La nabiyya ba'di). How do you interpret this?

**Qadiani** *(confused)*: Uh... that means no independent prophet, but a prophet who confirms Muhammad ﷺ can come...

**Muslim**: That's exactly what all false prophets said! Musaylimah the liar claimed the same thing!

</div>

**Decisive proofs of the seal of prophethood**:

> Allah تعالى says: ﴾Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but the Messenger of Allah and the **Seal of the Prophets** (خَاتَمَ النَّبِيِّينَ)﴿ [Al-Ahzab: 40]

> The Prophet ﷺ said: "I am the Seal of the Prophets, there is no prophet after me." [Al-Bukhari & Muslim]

> The Prophet ﷺ said: "There will be in my Ummah thirty great liars, each claiming to be a prophet. And I am the Seal of the Prophets, there is no prophet after me." [Ahmad, Tirmidhi]

---

### 2. The Denial of 'Isa's Death عليه السلام

| Islamic Belief | Qadiani Belief |
|----------------|----------------|
| 'Isa was raised alive to heaven | 'Isa died naturally |
| 'Isa will descend at the end of times | 'Isa will not return, Mirza replaced him |
| The true Messiah will return in Damascus | Mirza is the "metaphorical Messiah" |

**Their claim**: 'Isa died in Kashmir at 120 years old and his grave is there!

---

### 3. The Abolition of Jihad

<div class="quote-box">

**Mirza Ghulam Ahmad wrote**:

> "I grew up under the shadow of this beneficent government [British]... Jihad by the sword no longer has any justification today."

**The hidden reason**: Pleasing British colonialism which feared the Jihad of Indian Muslims.

**The context**: The British supported and funded this movement to neutralize Islamic resistance.

## 📜 Scene 3: Claims to Divinity

<div class="scene-box">

**Acre (Saint-Jean d'Acre), Ottoman Palestine — 1868**

*Husayn 'Ali an-Nuri, nicknamed "Baha'ullah" (Splendor of God), is in exile. But his ego knows no limits.*

**Baha'ullah** *(writing to his disciples)*: I am the One whom all prophets awaited. Moses awaited my coming, 'Isa awaited my coming, Muhammad ﷺ awaited my coming...

**A disciple**: Master, are you a prophet?

**Baha'ullah**: I am more than a prophet. I am the "Manifestation of God" (Mazhar Ilahi). God manifests Himself through me.

**The disciple**: But then... you are God?

**Baha'ullah** *(smiling)*: I am the mirror in which you see God. Worship me and you worship God.

*He writes in his sacred book "al-Aqdas" new laws: no Jihad, no mandatory veil, new prayer, new fasting...*

</div>

---

## ⚔️ The Foundations of Baha'i Belief

### 1. The Claim to Incarnate Divinity

| Concept | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Mazhar Ilahi** | God incarnates in "Manifestations" |
| **All religions are true** | Krishna, Buddha, Moses, 'Isa, Muhammad, the Bab, Baha'ullah = manifestations of the same God |
| **Baha'ullah is the most recent** | Therefore the most important |

---

### 2. The Abrogation of Islam

<div class="quote-box">

**What they believe**:

| Element | Baha'i Position |
|---------|-----------------|
| The Quran | Abrogated by "Kitab al-Aqdas" |
| The Shari'ah | Replaced by Baha'ullah's laws |
| The Hajj | Pilgrimage to Baha'ullah's house (Acre) |
| Prayer | 3 prayers per day, not 5 |
| Fasting | 19 days, not 30 |
| The Qiblah | Toward Acre, not Mecca |

</div>

---

### 3. The Unity of Religions

**Their slogan**: "All religions are one."

**What this implies**:
- ❌ No difference between Islam and polytheism
- ❌ No difference between Tawhid and Trinity
- ❌ All religions lead to the same goal

**The response**: Allah تعالى says: ﴾Whoever desires other than Islam as a religion, it will never be accepted from him﴿ [Aal 'Imran: 85]

---

### 4. The Abolition of Jihad and Punishments

| What they abolish | The hidden reason |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Jihad | No resistance to colonizers |
| Legal punishments (hudud) | Western "tolerance" |
| The obligation of the veil | Modernism |

---

## 🔍 Their Relationship with Colonialism and Zionism

<div class="quote-box">

**Troubling facts**:

1. **British support**: The British protected Baha'ullah and his successors
2. **Headquarters in Haifa**: Their world center is in occupied Palestine
3. **Cooperation with Israel**: They have never criticized Zionism
4. **Temple in Haifa**: Built with Israeli permission
5. **Exemption from military service**: Granted by Israel to Baha'is

**The question**: Why this close friendship between a "religion" born from Islam and the entity that occupies Al-Quds?

</div>

## 🎯 Contemporary Practical Cases

### Case 1: An Ahmadi (Qadiani) Friend

**Situation**: Your colleague says he is "Ahmadi" or "Muslim Ahmadiyya". He prays, fasts, says the shahada...

**Question**: How do you consider him?

**Answer**:
| Question to ask | If yes... |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Do you believe Mirza is a prophet? | He is a **disbeliever** |
| Do you believe prophethood is sealed with Muhammad ﷺ? | He is no longer Ahmadi |

⚠️ **Warning**: They use **Taqiyyah** and may hide their true beliefs.

---

### Case 2: Marriage with a Qadiani/Baha'i

**Question**: Can a Muslim woman marry a Qadiani or a Baha'i?

**Answer**:
- 🔴 **Absolutely forbidden** — It's like marrying a non-Muslim
- 🔴 The marriage is **invalid** (batil)
- 🔴 If she was already married and he converted → the marriage is dissolved

---

### Case 3: Eating Their Meat

**Question**: Can we eat meat slaughtered by a Qadiani or a Baha'i?

**Answer**:
- 🔴 **No** — Their sacrifice is not halal
- 🔴 They are not People of the Book (Ahl al-Kitab)
- 🔴 They are **apostates**, and the sacrifice of an apostate is not permissible

---

### Case 4: "All Religions Are Equal"

**Situation**: A Baha'i tells you: "We believe that all religions are true and lead to God."

**Question**: How to respond?

**Answer**:
1. Allah تعالى says: ﴾Indeed, the religion with Allah is Islam﴿ [Aal 'Imran: 19]
2. If all religions are true, why did Baha'ullah create a new religion?
3. Their "unity of religions" = **denial of Islam** as the final religion
