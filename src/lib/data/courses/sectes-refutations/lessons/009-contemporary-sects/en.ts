## Introduction

In the modern era, sects have appeared claiming to belong to Islam, but they have departed from it through claims to prophethood or changing its fundamentals.

## First Sect: The Qadianiyyah (Ahmadiyyah)

### Definition and Origin
- **Founder**: Mirza Ghulam Ahmad al-Qadiani (1835-1908)
- **Location**: Qadian, Punjab, India (under British occupation)
- **Foundation**: 1889

### The Stages of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's Claims

| Stage | Claim |
|-------|-------|
| First | Reformer and inspired one |
| Second | The awaited Mahdi |
| Third | The promised Messiah |
| Fourth | Prophet and messenger |

### The Foundations of Qadiani Belief

#### 1. Claim to Prophethood
- Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is a prophet
- He receives revelation from Allah
- Whoever does not believe in him is a disbeliever

#### 2. Denial of the Finality of Prophethood
- **Their interpretation**: Seal means the best and most beautiful, not the last
- **Their contradiction of consensus**: Muslims are unanimous that Muhammad ﷺ is the last of the prophets

#### 3. Denial of Jihad
- Jihad is abrogated
- Fighting is not permitted
- **The reason**: Pleasing British colonialism

#### 4. Change of Qiblah
- They make pilgrimage to Qadian instead of Mecca
- **The center**: Rabwah in Pakistan currently

### The Position of Muslims Toward the Qadianiyyah

> Islamic jurisprudential councils are unanimous that the Qadianiyyah is a **disbelieving sect** outside Islam:
- The Islamic Fiqh Academy (1974)
- The Muslim World League
- The Organization of the Islamic Conference

### Evidence of Their Disbelief
1. Allah تعالى says: {Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets} [Al-Ahzab: 40]
2. The Prophet ﷺ said: "There is no prophet after me." [Agreed upon]
3. The consensus of the Ummah on the finality of prophethood
