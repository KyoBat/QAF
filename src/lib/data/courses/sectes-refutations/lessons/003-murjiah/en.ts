## Definition of the Murji'ah

### Linguistic Meaning
Al-Irja': Postponement/delay, from the verse: {They said: Postpone him and his brother} [Ash-Shu'ara: 36]

### Technical Meaning
They are those who postponed actions from faith, saying: faith is only belief or statement, and actions are not part of it.

## The Emergence of Murji'ism

### Historical Context
Murji'ism appeared as a reaction to the Khawarij's excess in excommunicating sinners:
- Khawarij: every sin is disbelief
- Murji'ah: no sin harms faith

### The First to Profess Murji'ism
There is disagreement on this, but the most likely is that it appeared at the end of the first century of Hijrah.

## Types of Murji'ism

### 1. The Murji'ism of the Jahmiyyah and Asha'irah
| School | Definition of Faith |
|--------|---------------------|
| Jahmiyyah | Faith is only knowledge |
| Asha'irah | Faith is only heart's belief |

### 2. The Murji'ism of the Karramiyyah
Faith is only the statement of the tongue, even if the person is a hypocrite in his heart!

### 3. The Murji'ism of the Jurists (Murji'at al-Fuqaha')
Faith: the statement of the tongue and belief of the heart, and actions are a condition of perfection, not validity.
> Among them: Hammad ibn Abi Sulayman, the teacher of Abu Hanifa, and Abu Hanifa himself.

## The Foundations of Murji'ah Belief

### 1. Excluding Actions from Faith
- Actions are not a pillar of faith
- One who abandons all actions is a believer with complete faith according to their extremists

### 2. Faith Neither Increases Nor Decreases
- The faith of the most wicked person equals that of Jibril and Mika'il!
- No difference between believers in faith

### 3. No Sin Harms Faith
- This is the view of their extremists
- Sins have no effect on faith

## Refutation of the Murji'ah

### From the Quran

1. Allah تعالى says: {The true believers are only those who believe in Allah and His Messenger then doubt not, and struggle with their wealth and their persons} [Al-Hujurat: 15]

2. Allah تعالى says: {The true believers are only those whose hearts tremble when Allah is mentioned, and when His verses are recited to them, it increases their faith} [Al-Anfal: 2]

### From the Sunnah

1. The Prophet ﷺ said: "Faith has seventy-odd branches, the highest is saying 'La ilaha illa Allah', and the lowest is removing an obstacle from the road." [Agreed upon]

2. The Prophet ﷺ said: "The fornicator does not fornicate while being a believer at the time of fornication." [Agreed upon]

### By Reason

1. **Correlation between apparent and hidden**: One cannot conceive of sincere faith of the heart without apparent actions
2. **Reality testifies**: The true believer must manifest his faith in his behavior

## The Creed of Ahl as-Sunnah on Faith

### Definition of Faith
> Faith: statement of the tongue, belief of the heart, and actions of the limbs, which increases by obedience and decreases by disobedience.

### The Pillars of Faith According to Ahl as-Sunnah

\`\`\`
Faith
├── Statement of the tongue (the two testimonies)
├── Belief of the heart (firm certainty)
├── Actions of the heart (fear, hope, love)
└── Actions of the limbs (prayer, zakat...)
\`\`\`

### The Increase and Decrease of Faith
- It increases by acts of obedience
- It decreases by disobedience
- People differ in their level of faith

## The Danger of Murji'ism

### 1. Minimizing Actions
Leads to laziness and neglect of obligations

### 2. Opening the Door to Wickedness and Sins
If actions are not part of faith, what is the motivation to act?

### 3. Contradiction with the Consensus of the Salaf
The Salaf unanimously agreed that faith is statement and action

## The Impact of Murji'ism Today

### Contemporary Manifestations
- Those who say: "What matters is what's in the heart"
- The separation between religion and behavior
- Justifying shortcomings in worship

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf: Al-Hasan al-Basri and Faith

A man came to al-Hasan al-Basri رحمه الله and said: *"O Abu Sa'id, are you a believer?"*

Al-Hasan said: *"Faith is of two kinds: If you ask me about faith in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day, Paradise, Hell, resurrection and reckoning, then I am a believer. But if you ask me about the verse: {The believers are only those whose hearts tremble when Allah is mentioned}, then by Allah, I do not know if I am among them or not!"*

He used to say: *"Faith is not by wishful thinking nor by adornment, but what settles in the heart and is confirmed by actions."*

**Lesson learned**: True faith cannot be an empty claim; it must manifest in action. Balance between fear and hope is required.

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases: Manifestations of Murji'ism

### Case 1: "What Matters is What's in the Heart"
A person doesn't pray or fast, and when advised says: *"Allah knows what's in my heart, I'm a believer inside!"*

**Question**: Is what's in the heart sufficient without action?

**Answer**: ❌ No. This is the essence of Murji'ite thought. True faith must manifest in action. Allah تعالى says: {Say, if you truly love Allah, then follow me}. Claims without action are false claims.

---

### Case 2: Equality in Faith
Someone says: *"My faith is like Abu Bakr as-Siddiq's faith! We're all Muslims!"*

**Question**: Are people equal in faith?

**Answer**: ❌ No. Faith increases and decreases. Abu Bakr's faith is not like anyone else's. The Prophet ﷺ said: *"If Abu Bakr's faith were placed on one scale and the faith of the Ummah on the other, Abu Bakr's faith would outweigh it."*

---

### Case 3: Separating Religion from Life
A merchant cheats in his trade and says: *"Religion is in the mosque, and business has its own rules!"*

**Question**: Can faith be separated from behavior?

**Answer**: ❌ No. Separating religion from life is a manifestation of contemporary Murji'ism. Islam is a comprehensive system that governs all aspects of life.

---

### Case 4: Minimizing Sins
A young man commits sins and says: *"Allah is Forgiving, Merciful, and my sins don't affect my faith!"*

**Question**: Do sins affect faith?

**Answer**: ✅ Yes. Faith decreases by disobedience and increases by obedience. The Prophet ﷺ said: *"The fornicator does not fornicate while being a believer at the time."* Sin weakens faith even if it doesn't remove it.

---

### Case 5: Delaying Repentance
A man says: *"I'll repent when I get older, now I'll enjoy my youth, faith is in my heart!"*

**Question**: Is it permissible to delay repentance while claiming faith?

**Answer**: ❌ No. This is dangerous procrastination and an effect of Murji'ism. Repentance is immediately obligatory, and a person has no guarantee of his lifespan.

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

**Personal question**: Do you rely on "what's in your heart" or do you translate your faith into daily action?

**Remember:**
- Faith is not just a claim, but belief and action
- It's not enough to love Allah in your heart, you must obey Him
- Your faith increases every time you obey Allah, and decreases every time you disobey
- Monitor your actions, for they are the mirror of your faith

## Conclusion

| Group | Definition of Faith | Ruling |
|-------|---------------------|--------|
| Ahl as-Sunnah | Statement, action and belief, increases and decreases | The truth |
| Extreme Murji'ah | Knowledge or belief only | False |
| Murji'at al-Fuqaha' | Statement and belief, actions condition of perfection | Mild innovation |
