## Definition of the Murji'ah

### Linguistic Meaning
Al-Irja': Postponement/delay, from the verse: {They said: Postpone him and his brother} [Ash-Shu'ara: 36]

### Technical Meaning
They are those who postponed actions from faith, saying: faith is only belief or statement, and actions are not part of it.

## The Emergence of Murji'ism

### Historical Context
Murji'ism appeared as a reaction to the Khawarij's excess in excommunicating sinners:
- Khawarij: every sin is disbelief
- Murji'ah: no sin harms faith

### The First to Profess Murji'ism
There is disagreement on this, but the most likely is that it appeared at the end of the first century of Hijrah.

## Types of Murji'ism

### 1. The Murji'ism of the Jahmiyyah and Asha'irah
| School | Definition of Faith |
|--------|---------------------|
| Jahmiyyah | Faith is only knowledge |
| Asha'irah | Faith is only heart's belief |

### 2. The Murji'ism of the Karramiyyah
Faith is only the statement of the tongue, even if the person is a hypocrite in his heart!

### 3. The Murji'ism of the Jurists (Murji'at al-Fuqaha')
Faith: the statement of the tongue and belief of the heart, and actions are a condition of perfection, not validity.
> Among them: Hammad ibn Abi Sulayman, the teacher of Abu Hanifa, and Abu Hanifa himself.

## The Foundations of Murji'ah Belief

### 1. Excluding Actions from Faith
- Actions are not a pillar of faith
- One who abandons all actions is a believer with complete faith according to their extremists

### 2. Faith Neither Increases Nor Decreases
- The faith of the most wicked person equals that of Jibril and Mika'il!
- No difference between believers in faith

### 3. No Sin Harms Faith
- This is the view of their extremists
- Sins have no effect on faith

## Refutation of the Murji'ah

### From the Quran

1. Allah تعالى says: {The true believers are only those who believe in Allah and His Messenger then doubt not, and struggle with their wealth and their persons} [Al-Hujurat: 15]

2. Allah تعالى says: {The true believers are only those whose hearts tremble when Allah is mentioned, and when His verses are recited to them, it increases their faith} [Al-Anfal: 2]

### From the Sunnah

1. The Prophet ﷺ said: "Faith has seventy-odd branches, the highest is saying 'La ilaha illa Allah', and the lowest is removing an obstacle from the road." [Agreed upon]

2. The Prophet ﷺ said: "The fornicator does not fornicate while being a believer at the time of fornication." [Agreed upon]

### By Reason

1. **Correlation between apparent and hidden**: One cannot conceive of sincere faith of the heart without apparent actions
2. **Reality testifies**: The true believer must manifest his faith in his behavior

## The Creed of Ahl as-Sunnah on Faith

### Definition of Faith
> Faith: statement of the tongue, belief of the heart, and actions of the limbs, which increases by obedience and decreases by disobedience.

### The Pillars of Faith According to Ahl as-Sunnah

\`\`\`
Faith
├── Statement of the tongue (the two testimonies)
├── Belief of the heart (firm certainty)
├── Actions of the heart (fear, hope, love)
└── Actions of the limbs (prayer, zakat...)
\`\`\`

### The Increase and Decrease of Faith
- It increases by acts of obedience
- It decreases by disobedience
- People differ in their level of faith

## The Danger of Murji'ism

### 1. Minimizing Actions
Leads to laziness and neglect of obligations

### 2. Opening the Door to Wickedness and Sins
If actions are not part of faith, what is the motivation to act?

### 3. Contradiction with the Consensus of the Salaf
The Salaf unanimously agreed that faith is statement and action

## The Impact of Murji'ism Today

### Contemporary Manifestations
- Those who say: "What matters is what's in the heart"
- The separation between religion and behavior
- Justifying shortcomings in worship

## Conclusion

| Group | Definition of Faith | Ruling |
|-------|---------------------|--------|
| Ahl as-Sunnah | Statement, action and belief, increases and decreases | The truth |
| Extreme Murji'ah | Knowledge or belief only | False |
| Murji'at al-Fuqaha' | Statement and belief, actions condition of perfection | Mild innovation |
