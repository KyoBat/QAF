## 🎬 Introduction

If the Khawarij excommunicated Muslims for their sins, the **Murji'ah** fell into the opposite extreme: they said that **actions are not part of faith**, and that the sinner has perfect faith like that of the angels!

This deviation, more subtle than that of the Khawarij, has had a **devastating impact** on the religious practice of Muslims throughout the centuries.

<!-- TIMELINE:murjiah-history -->

## 📜 Part 1: Definition and Origin

### Etymology of the Word

| Term | Root | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| **Murji'ah** | irja' (أَرْجَأَ) | To postpone, delay, defer |
| **Source verse** | ﴾They said: Postpone him (Musa) and his brother﴿ | [Ash-Shu'ara: 36] |
| **Applied meaning** | They "postponed" actions | Actions are not part of faith |

### The Context of Emergence

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 SCENE: The Reaction to the Khawarij — Kufa, End of 1st Century H**

*Scholars discuss the chaos caused by the Khawarij.*

**First scholar**: "The Khawarij have made the blood of Muslims lawful because of their sins. This is a catastrophe!"

**Second scholar**: "Perhaps the solution is to say that sins don't affect faith? That way, no one can excommunicate anyone."

**Third scholar** *(wisely)*: "Be careful! In fleeing one extreme, don't fall into the other. Actions are part of faith, but the sinner is not a kafir."

*But some chose the easy path and founded Murji'ism.*

</div>

### Chronology

\`\`\`
Emergence of Murji'ism
├── ~35-40 H: Excess of the Khawarij (takfir of sinners)
├── ~70-100 H: Opposite reaction → Birth of Murji'ism
├── ~128 H: Jahm ibn Safwan (extreme Murji'ism)
└── Following centuries: Influence on Ash'arism

## 📚 Part 2: Types of Murji'ism

### Classification by Severity

| Type | Definition of Faith | Severity | Representatives |
|------|---------------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Jahmiyyah** | Knowledge alone (ma'rifa) | 🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴 | Jahm ibn Safwan |
| **Karramiyyah** | Statement of tongue alone | 🔴🔴🔴🔴 | Muhammad ibn Karram |
| **Asha'irah/Maturidiyyah** | Heart's belief alone | 🔴🔴🔴 | Al-Ash'ari (phase 2), al-Maturidi |
| **Murji'at al-Fuqaha'** | Statement + belief, actions = perfection | 🟡🟡 | Hammad, Abu Hanifa |

### Extreme Murji'ism: The Jahmiyyah

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 SCENE: Jahm's Doctrine — Transoxiana, ~128 H**

**Disciple**: "O Jahm, what is faith?"

**Jahm ibn Safwan**: "Faith is the knowledge (ma'rifa) of Allah in the heart. Whoever knows Allah is a believer, even if he doesn't pronounce the shahada nor pray."

**Disciple**: "But Iblis knows Allah! Is he a believer?"

**Jahm** *(embarrassed)*: "..."

</div>

**Fatal problem**: According to this definition, **Iblis and Pharaoh** would be believers because they knew Allah!

### The Murji'ism of the Karramiyyah

| Belief | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| Faith = the shahada on the tongue | A lying hypocrite is a "believer"! |
| No need for heart's belief | Contrary to consensus |
| Invented by Muhammad ibn Karram (d. 255H) | Extinct sect |

### The Murji'ism of the Jurists (The Mildest)

<div class="quote-box">

**Their position:**

"Faith is the statement of the tongue **and** the belief of the heart. Actions are a **condition of perfection**, not of validity."

**Among them**: Hammad ibn Abi Sulayman (Abu Hanifa's teacher), and according to some, Abu Hanifa himself.

</div>

**Important nuance**: This type is the **least severe** because they:
- Affirm the obligation of actions
- Say that whoever abandons them is sinful
- Differ from Ahl as-Sunnah on: are actions **part** of faith or its **consequence**?

---

## ⚡ Part 3: Foundations of Murji'ism

### 1. Excluding Actions from Faith

\`\`\`
Comparison of Definitions of Faith
├── KHAWARIJ
│   └── Faith = Belief + Statement + Actions (every sin = kufr)
│
├── EXTREME MURJI'AH
│   └── Faith = Knowledge or Belief alone (actions outside faith)
│
└── AHL AS-SUNNAH
    └── Faith = Belief + Statement + Actions (sin ≠ kufr, but weakens faith)
\`\`\`

### 2. Faith Neither Increases Nor Decreases

| Murji'ite Belief | Ahl as-Sunnah Position |
|------------------|------------------------|
| All equal in faith | Faith differs from person to person |
| Sinner's faith = Jibril's faith | Abu Bakr > other believers |
| No variation | Increases by obedience, decreases by sin |

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 SCENE: The Absurdity of Their Position**

**Murji'i**: "My faith is like that of Jibril!"

**Sunni**: "Your faith is like that of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq?"

**Murji'i**: "Yes! We are all believers!"

**Sunni**: "The Prophet ﷺ said: 'If Abu Bakr's faith were placed on one scale and the faith of the Ummah on the other, Abu Bakr's faith would outweigh it.' You claim to have Abu Bakr's faith?"

**Murji'i** *(silent)*: "..."

</div>

### 3. Sins Do Not Harm Faith

| Their Claim | Reality |
|-------------|---------|
| "Sin doesn't affect faith" | The Prophet ﷺ: "The fornicator does not fornicate while being a believer..." |
| "What matters is the heart" | Allah: "Say: If you love Allah, follow me" |
| "No difference between believers" | Allah: "...those whose faith increases when His verses are recited to them" |

---

## 📖 Part 4: Detailed Refutation

### Proofs from the Quran

| Verse | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| ﴾The believers are only those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, then doubt not, and strive﴿ | Faith includes actions (jihad) |
| ﴾Those whose hearts tremble when Allah is mentioned, and when His verses are recited to them, it increases their faith﴿ | Faith **increases** |
| ﴾Say: If you love Allah, follow me﴿ | Love requires obedience |

### Proofs from the Sunnah

<div class="quote-box">

**Hadith 1 — The branches of faith:**

**"Faith has seventy-odd branches. The highest is 'La ilaha illa Allah', and the lowest is removing an obstacle from the road."** [Al-Bukhari 9, Muslim 35]

**Proof**: Removing an obstacle = **action** = branch of faith

</div>

<div class="quote-box">

**Hadith 2 — The fornicator's faith:**

**"The fornicator does not fornicate while being a believer at the moment he fornicates."** [Al-Bukhari 2475, Muslim 57]

**Proof**: Sin **decreases** faith

</div>

### Rational Proofs

| Argument | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|
| **Correlation between apparent and hidden** | One cannot conceive sincere faith of the heart without apparent action |
| **Reality testifies** | The true believer must manifest his faith in his behavior |
| **Faith is a motivator** | True belief inevitably generates action |

## 🗡️ Part 5: The Creed of Ahl as-Sunnah

### Definition of Faith According to Ahl as-Sunnah

<div class="quote-box">

**The comprehensive definition:**

**Faith: statement of the tongue, belief of the heart, and actions of the limbs, which increases by obedience and decreases by disobedience.**

</div>

### Pillars of Faith

\`\`\`

### Comparison Table

| Issue | Khawarij | Murji'ah | Ahl as-Sunnah |
|-------|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Actions part of faith?** | Yes | No | Yes |
| **Does sin cause kufr?** | Yes | No | No |
| **Does sin decrease faith?** | Expels from it | No | Yes |
| **Does faith vary?** | No | No | Yes |
| **Ruling on major sin committer** | Kafir | Perfect believer | Believer with deficient faith |

## ⚠️ Part 6: The Danger of Murji'ism

### 1. Minimizing the Importance of Actions

| Effect | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Actions are not part of faith | Why should I strive? |
| Sin doesn't harm faith | Why avoid sins? |
| We're all equal in faith | Why seek excellence? |

### 2. Opening the Door to Wickedness

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 SCENE: The Murji'i's Practical Logic**

**Young Murji'i**: "I am a believer in my heart. Sins don't affect my faith."

**Advising friend**: "But you don't pray!"

**Murji'i**: "Prayer is not part of faith, it's only perfection."

**Advisor**: "And you drink alcohol!"

**Murji'i**: "My faith is not affected by this."

**Advisor**: "So what motivates you to obey?"

**Murji'i** *(silent)*: "..."

</div>

### 3. Contradicting the Consensus of the Salaf

<div class="quote-box">

**Imam ash-Shafi'i رحمه الله said:**

**"Faith is statement, action, and belief, which increases by obedience and decreases by disobedience."**

**This is the consensus of the Salaf.**

</div>

## 📖 Part 7: The Story of Al-Hasan al-Basri and Faith

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 SCENE: The Humility of the Scholar — Basra, End of 1st Century H**

*A man comes to al-Hasan al-Basri رحمه الله.*

**The man**: "O Abu Sa'id, are you a believer?"

**Al-Hasan al-Basri** *(humbly)*: "Faith is of two kinds. If you ask me about faith in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day, Paradise, Hell, resurrection, and reckoning, then I am a believer."

**The man**: "And what about the other faith?"

**Al-Hasan**: "But if you ask me about the verse: ﴾The believers are only those whose hearts tremble when Allah is mentioned﴿, then by Allah, I do not know if I am among them or not!"

*He used to say:*

**"Faith is not by wishful thinking nor by adornment, but what settles in the heart and is confirmed by actions."**

</div>

**Lesson**: True faith is not an empty claim; it must manifest in action. Balance between fear and hope is required.

---

## 🎯 Part 8: Contemporary Case Studies

### Case 1: "What Matters is What's in the Heart"

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 SCENE: The Repeated Excuse — Today**

**One who abandons prayer**: "I don't pray, but my heart is good. Allah knows what's in my heart!"

**Advisor**: "What prevents you from praying?"

**Abandoner**: "Prayer is in the heart!"

**Advisor**: "Allah تعالى says: ﴾Say: If you love Allah, follow me﴿. Claims without action are false claims."

</div>

**Ruling**: ❌ This is the core of Murji'ite thought. True faith must manifest in action.

---

### Case 2: Equality in Faith

**Situation**: Someone says: "My faith is like Abu Bakr as-Siddiq's! We're all Muslims!"

| Claim | Response |
|-------|----------|
| We're all equal | Faith varies |
| No one is better | Abu Bakr is better |
| What matters is being Muslim | What matters is faith and action |

<div class="quote-box">

**The Prophet ﷺ said:**

**"If Abu Bakr's faith were placed on one scale and the faith of the Ummah on the other, Abu Bakr's faith would outweigh it."**

*No equality!*

</div>

---

### Case 3: Separating Religion from Life

**Situation**: A merchant cheats in his trade and says: "Religion is in the mosque, and business has its own rules!"

| Error | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| Religion = worship only | Islam is a comprehensive system |
| Life is separate | All of life is worship |
| Morals are optional | Morals are part of faith |

**Ruling**: ❌ This is a manifestation of contemporary Murji'ism. Islam governs all aspects of life.

---

### Case 4: Minimizing Sins

**Situation**: A young man commits sins and says: "Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. My sins don't affect my faith!"

<div class="quote-box">

**The Prophet ﷺ said:**

**"The fornicator does not fornicate while being a believer at the moment he fornicates."**

**Sin weakens faith even if it doesn't expel from it.**

</div>

**Ruling**: ⚠️ Sins decrease faith. Relying on forgiveness without repentance = delusion.

---

### Case 5: Delaying Repentance

**Situation**: A man says: "I'll repent when I get older. Now I'll enjoy my youth, and faith is in my heart!"

| Error | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| Repentance isn't urgent | Repentance is obligatory **immediately** |
| Life is long | **No guarantee** of lifespan |
| Faith in the heart is enough | Faith = statement + action + belief |

**Ruling**: ❌ Dangerous procrastination. He may die before repenting!

---

## 💡 Pause for Reflection

### Personal Questions

- Do you rely on "what's in your heart" or do you translate your faith into daily action?
- Do you think your faith is unaffected by your sins?
- Do you separate your religion from your practical life?
- Do you delay repentance and righteous deeds?

### Remember

- ✅ Faith is not just a claim, but belief and action
- ✅ It's not enough to love Allah in your heart; you must obey Him
- ✅ Your faith increases every time you obey Allah, and decreases every time you disobey
- ✅ Monitor your actions, for they are the mirror of your faith
