## Introduction

The Shi'a constitute one of the largest and oldest sects in Islamic history. This lesson explores their emergence, doctrinal evolution, their numerous branches, and the response of Ahl as-Sunnah to their beliefs.

# Part 1: The Birth of a Division

## 📜 Definition of the Shi'a

### Etymology
**Shi'a** (شِيعة): Followers and supporters, as in the verse:
> ﴾And indeed, among his followers (شِيعَتِهِ) was Ibrahim﴿ [As-Saffat: 83]

### Technical Meaning
They are those who supported 'Ali رضي الله عنه and claimed his right to the caliphate **directly** after the Prophet ﷺ, believing that the first three caliphs usurped a right that belonged to him.

## 📜 Scene 1: The Day of Saqifa — When the Ummah Chose

<div class="scene-box">

**Medina — Year 11 of Hijra — Hours after the death of the Prophet ﷺ**

*The news of the death of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ spreads like shockwaves. While 'Ali and the Banu Hashim prepare the blessed body, the Ansar gather at the Saqifa (portico) of Banu Sa'ida.*

**Abu Bakr** *(arriving with 'Umar and Abu 'Ubayda)*: We heard that you have gathered. What is your matter?

**Sa'd ibn 'Ubadah** *(chief of the Ansar, weakened by illness)*: We propose: "One emir from us, and one emir from you."

**Abu Bakr** *(with calm and wisdom)*: The Arabs will never accept to be ruled by other than Quraysh. The Prophet ﷺ said: "The Imams are from Quraysh."

*The debate intensifies. 'Umar fears the fitna.*

**Abu Bakr** *(extending his hand toward 'Umar and Abu 'Ubayda)*: Pledge allegiance to one of these two men.

**'Umar** *(grasping Abu Bakr's hand)*: Rather to you, O companion of the Prophet in the cave! I pledge allegiance to you!

*The Ansar and the Muhajirun present pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr. Thus the first caliph was chosen.*

</div>

<div class="quote-box">

**Key Question**: Where was 'Ali?

'Ali رضي الله عنه was busy preparing the body of the Prophet ﷺ for burial — a responsibility that he and the Banu Hashim assumed. He pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr a few days later.

</div>

## ⏳ The Evolution of Shi'ism

### The Beginning: A Political Position (36 H)
Initially, Shi'ism was merely **political support** for 'Ali during his conflict with Mu'awiya:
- Those who supported 'Ali = "Shi'at 'Ali"
- It was not a doctrinal disagreement

### The Doctrinal Transformation

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Scene 2: The Entry of the Wolf — 'Abdullah ibn Saba'**

**Yemen then Medina — Era of 'Uthman رضي الله عنه**

*A Jew named 'Abdullah ibn Saba' feigns Islam. He travels between Muslim cities, sowing discord.*

**Ibn Saba'** *(whispering to his secret followers)*: How can you accept that 'Ali be the fourth? Every prophet has an heir! Moses had Joshua, 'Isa had Peter... and Muhammad ﷺ has 'Ali!

**A naive person**: But Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthman...

**Ibn Saba'**: Usurpers! They stole 'Ali's right! Is he not his cousin and son-in-law? Was he not the first man to embrace Islam?

*His poisonous words find listening ears. Later, he would go so far as to claim that 'Ali is divine.*

**'Ali** *(learning of Ibn Saba's excesses)*: I disavow before Allah this man and what he says!

*He ordered the burning of the extremists who deified him.*

# Part 2: The Beliefs of the Imamiyyah Twelvers

## 🏛️ The Twelve Imams

<div class="quote-box">

**The Chain of Twelve Imams According to the Imamiyyah**:

| # | Imam | Relation | Death |
|---|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | 'Ali ibn Abi Talib | Son-in-law of the Prophet ﷺ | 40 H |
| 2 | Al-Hasan ibn 'Ali | Son of 'Ali | 50 H |
| 3 | Al-Husayn ibn 'Ali | Son of 'Ali | 61 H |
| 4 | 'Ali Zayn al-'Abidin | Son of Husayn | 94 H |
| 5 | Muhammad al-Baqir | Son of Zayn al-'Abidin | 114 H |
| 6 | Ja'far as-Sadiq | Son of al-Baqir | 148 H |
| 7 | Musa al-Kazim | Son of Ja'far | 183 H |
| 8 | 'Ali ar-Rida | Son of Musa | 203 H |
| 9 | Muhammad al-Jawad | Son of ar-Rida | 220 H |
| 10 | 'Ali al-Hadi | Son of al-Jawad | 254 H |
| 11 | Al-Hasan al-'Askari | Son of al-Hadi | 260 H |
| 12 | Muhammad al-Mahdi | Son of al-'Askari | **Occluded** (according to them) |

</div>

**The 12th Imam — The Hidden Imam**:
According to the Imamiyyah, the 12th Imam entered into "occultation" in 260 H at the age of 5 and is still living in a cellar, awaiting to reappear at the end of times.

## ⚖️ The Foundations of Their Belief

### 1. The Imamate (الإمامة)

| Imamite Belief | What They Claim |
|----------------|-----------------|
| The Imamate is a **pillar of faith** | Greater than prayer and zakat |
| The Imamate by **text** (nass) | The Prophet ﷺ explicitly designated 'Ali |
| The Imams are **infallible** | They never err, like the prophets |
| The Imams have **knowledge of the unseen** | They know what was and what will be |

### 2. Taqiyyah (التقية) — Dissimulation

<div class="quote-box">

**Definition**: Showing the opposite of what one hides for protection or deception.

**In their books**:
> "Taqiyyah is nine-tenths of the religion, and whoever has no Taqiyyah has no religion." — Al-Kafi

**The problem**: This doctrine allows them to lie to Sunnis about their true beliefs.

</div>

### 3. Position Toward the Companions — The Heart of the Conflict

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Scene 3: What They Actually Say in Their Books**

*In al-Kafi, their most authentic book:*

**Imamite text**: "The people became apostates after the death of the Prophet ﷺ, except for three persons."

*In another passage:*

**Imamite text**: "'Umar is the greatest sinner of this Ummah after Pharaoh and Haman."

*In their 'Ashura rituals:*

**Mourning crowds**: Curse upon those who usurped the right of Fatima! Curse upon those who broke her rib!

</div>

**What they believe about the Companions**:
- ❌ Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 'Uthman = usurping disbelievers
- ❌ 'A'ishah = slandered and cursed
- ❌ The majority of the Companions = apostates
- ✅ Only a few Companions remained faithful according to them

---

### 4. The Return (الرجعة)

Belief in the return of some dead before the Day of Judgment:
- The Imams will return to rule
- Their enemies (Abu Bakr, 'Umar...) will return to be punished
- ⚠️ No basis in the Quran or authentic Sunnah

---

# Part 3: Refutation by Proofs

## 📖 On the Imamate of 'Ali by Text

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Scene 4: 'Ali Himself Refutes This Claim**

**A man**: O Commander of the Believers! Did the Prophet ﷺ entrust you with something that he did not entrust to others?

**'Ali رضي الله عنه**: No, by the One Who split the grain and created the soul! I have nothing except the understanding that Allah grants a man of the Book, and what is in this paper.

**The man**: What is in this paper?

**'Ali**: The rulings of blood money, the liberation of captives, and that a Muslim is not killed for a disbeliever.

*[Reported by al-Bukhari]*

</div>

<div class="quote-box">

**Decisive Arguments Against the "Nass"** (textual designation):

1. **If the Prophet ﷺ had designated 'Ali**, why did 'Ali pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr, 'Umar, and 'Uthman?

2. **If the Prophet ﷺ had designated 'Ali**, why did 'Ali never use this argument when he needed it most (Saqifa, 'Umar's Shura)?

3. **The sons of 'Ali** — Al-Hasan and al-Husayn — pledged allegiance to Mu'awiya and never claimed any "divine right."

</div>

---

## 📖 On the Infallibility of the Imams

**No proof** in the Quran or authentic Sunnah.

**Moreover, the "Imams" themselves never claimed infallibility**:

> Ja'far as-Sadiq said: "I am only a man, I am right and I err."

---

## 📖 On Insulting the Companions — Verses of Defense

<div class="quote-box">

**Allah تعالى has promised Paradise to the Companions**:

> ﴾Allah was pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you under the tree﴿ [Al-Fath: 18]

> ﴾The first forerunners among the Emigrants and the Helpers, and those who followed them in goodness, Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him﴿ [At-Tawbah: 100]

**The Prophet ﷺ said**:
> "Do not insult my Companions! By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, if one of you spent the equivalent of Mount Uhud in gold, he would not reach the mudd of one of them nor even half of it." [Al-Bukhari & Muslim]

</div>

---

## 🔍 The Fatal Contradiction

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Scene 5: The Reasoning That Confounds Them**

**Teacher**: Think carefully... According to them, the Imams are infallible and know the unseen.

**Student**: Yes, that's what they claim.

**Teacher**: Al-Hasan, the 2nd Imam, ceded the caliphate to Mu'awiya and made peace with him. Mu'awiya is, according to them, the sworn enemy of the Ahl al-Bayt.

**Student**: That's what they say.

**Teacher**: So either Al-Hasan was not infallible — since he made peace with "the enemy" — or his peace with Mu'awiya was the right decision, which refutes all their hatred toward the Companions.

**Student**: They cannot have both...

**Teacher**: Exactly. Their system collapses from within.

</div>

# Part 4: Contemporary Case Studies

## 🎯 Case 1: "Sunnis and Shi'ites are the same, right?"

**A friend tells you**: "The differences between Sunnis and Shi'ites are minor, it's just politics."

**Question**: How do you respond?

**Answer**:
| Subject | Sunnis | Shi'ite Imamiyyah |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| The Companions | All honored | The majority excommunicated |
| The Imamate | Not a pillar | Pillar of faith |
| Abu Bakr, 'Umar | Best after the Prophet ﷺ | Cursed usurpers |
| 'A'ishah | Mother of the Believers | Slandered |
| The Quran | Preserved | Some say it is falsified |

⚠️ **These are not minor differences** — it is insulting the best of the Ummah.

---

## 🎯 Case 2: Visiting Shrines (Tombs of the Imams)

**Question**: What is the ruling on the Shi'ite pilgrimage to the tombs of the Imams?

**Answer**:
- 🔴 **Calling upon the dead** = Major shirk
- 🔴 **Circumambulating the tombs** = Imitation of Hajj rites
- 🔴 **Believing that the Imam hears and responds** = Attributing a divine attribute

---

## 🎯 Case 3: The 'Ashura Beatings

**Question**: What is the ruling on the flagellations and self-inflicted wounds that some Shi'ites perform during 'Ashura?

**Answer**:
- ❌ **The Prophet ﷺ forbade** striking the face and tearing garments in mourning
- ❌ **Al-Husayn رضي الله عنه** would never have approved of this
- ❌ These practices come from **pre-Islamic pagan rituals**

# Part 5: Summary Table of Branches

| Branch | Position Toward the Sahaba | Doctrinal Excesses | Ruling |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Zaydiyyah** | Accept Abu Bakr and 'Umar | Few excesses | Closest to the Sunnah |
| **Imamiyyah** | Excommunicate the majority | Imamate, Taqiyyah, Raj'ah | Grave innovators |
| **Isma'iliyyah** | Reject the Companions | Esotericism, Batiniyyah | Dangerous sects |
| **Ghulat** (Nusayris, Druze) | Total rejection | Deification of 'Ali | **Disbelievers** by consensus |

---

## 💡 The Balanced Position of Ahl as-Sunnah

<div class="quote-box">

**Toward 'Ali and Ahl al-Bayt**:
- ✅ We love them for Allah
- ✅ We recognize their immense virtues
- ✅ 'Ali is the 4th Rightly-Guided Caliph

**Toward the other Companions**:
- ✅ We love them all
- ✅ We refuse to judge in their conflicts
- ✅ We ask Allah to be pleased with them all

**We reject**:
- ❌ The excess of the Nawasib (those who hate 'Ali)
- ❌ The excess of the Rawafid (those who reject the Companions)

</div>

> The Prophet ﷺ said concerning 'Ali: "Only a believer will love you, and only a hypocrite will hate you." [Muslim]

But loving 'Ali does not mean hating Abu Bakr and 'Umar!

---

## ✅ Conclusion

1. **Shi'ism began** as a political position, then transformed into a doctrinal sect
2. **The branches vary** — from moderates (Zaydiyyah) to extremists (Ghulat)
3. **The Imamate by text, infallibility, and rejection of the Companions** are grave innovations
4. **Ahl as-Sunnah** love all the Companions and the Ahl al-Bayt without excess or neglect
