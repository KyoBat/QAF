## Introduction

The Shi'a are one of the largest Islamic sects and most influential in Islamic history. They have many branches that vary in their distance from the Sunnah.

## Definition of the Shi'a

### Linguistic Meaning
Shi'a: Followers and supporters, as in the verse: {And indeed, among his followers was Ibrahim} [As-Saffat: 83]

### Technical Meaning
They are those who supported 'Ali رضي الله عنه and claimed his right to the caliphate directly after the Prophet ﷺ.

## The Emergence of Shi'ism

### The Political Beginning
Shi'ism began as a political stance during the caliphate of 'Ali رضي الله عنه:
- Some Muslims' support for 'Ali in his conflict with Mu'awiya
- It was not a doctrinal disagreement at first

### The Doctrinal Transformation
Shi'ism transformed from a political stance to a doctrinal sect due to:
1. **'Abdullah ibn Saba'** — A Jew who displayed Islam and exaggerated concerning 'Ali
2. **The extremists** who deified 'Ali
3. **The preachers** who established the doctrinal foundations of Shi'ism

## The Foundations of Imamite Belief

### 1. The Imamate
| Belief | Details |
|--------|---------|
| The Imamate is a pillar of religion | Greater than prayer and zakat |
| The Imamate by text | The previous Imam designates the next |
| The Imams are infallible | They never err |
| The Imams know the unseen | According to some of them |

### 2. The Twelve Imams
1. 'Ali ibn Abi Talib
2. Al-Hasan ibn 'Ali
3. Al-Husayn ibn 'Ali
4. 'Ali Zayn al-'Abidin
5. Muhammad al-Baqir
6. Ja'far as-Sadiq
7. Musa al-Kazim
8. 'Ali ar-Rida
9. Muhammad al-Jawad
10. 'Ali al-Hadi
11. Al-Hasan al-'Askari
12. Muhammad al-Mahdi (the Occluded)

### 3. Taqiyyah
- Showing the opposite of what one hides
- Permitted for them, even obligatory sometimes

### 4. The Return (Raj'ah)
- Return of some dead before the Day of Judgment
- Return of the Imams and oppressors

### 5. Position Toward the Companions
- **Excommunication of most Companions** — like Abu Bakr, 'Umar, and 'Uthman
- **Cursing them** and disassociating from them
- **Slandering 'A'ishah** the Mother of the Believers

## Refutation of Shi'ite Beliefs

### On the Imamate
1. **No text on 'Ali's imamate** in the Quran or authentic Sunnah
2. **If the text existed**, it would not have been hidden from the senior Companions
3. **'Ali himself** pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr, 'Umar, and 'Uthman

### On the Infallibility of the Imams
1. **No proof of infallibility** in the Quran or Sunnah
2. **Infallibility is for Prophets only** in conveying the message
3. **The Imams themselves** did not claim infallibility

### On Insulting the Companions
1. Allah تعالى says: {Allah was pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you under the tree} [Al-Fath: 18]
2. Allah تعالى says: {And the first forerunners among the Emigrants and the Helpers} [At-Tawbah: 100]
3. The Prophet ﷺ said: "Do not insult my Companions, for by the One in Whose Hand is my soul, if one of you spent the equivalent of Uhud in gold, he would not reach the mudd of one of them, nor even half of it." [Agreed upon]

## Conclusion

| Branch | Ruling |
|--------|--------|
| Zaydiyyah | Closest to the Sunnah, don't excommunicate Companions |
| Imamiyyah | Innovators, excommunicate those who excommunicate Companions |
| Isma'iliyyah | Dangerous esoteric sects |
| Extremists (Nusayriyyah, Druze) | Disbelievers by consensus of Muslims |
