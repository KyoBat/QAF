## Introduction to the Issue of Predestination

### The Importance of Believing in Predestination
Belief in predestination is one of the six pillars of faith, according to the Prophet's ﷺ statement in the hadith of Jibril:
> "That you believe in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day, and that you believe in predestination, its good and evil." [Reported by Muslim]

### The Required Balance
Ahl as-Sunnah are in the middle between two extremes:
- **Qadariyyah**: Those who deny predestination
- **Jabriyyah**: Those who exaggerate in predestination

---

## First Sect: The Qadariyyah

### Their Definition
They are those who denied predestination, claiming that matters occur without prior determination, and that Allah does not know things until they happen.

### Their Origin
- The first to deny predestination: **Ma'bad al-Juhani** at the end of the Companions' era
- The Companions disassociated from him, like Ibn 'Umar رضي الله عنهما

### Ibn 'Umar's Position on Them
When asked about the Qadariyyah, he said:
> "Tell them that I disassociate from them and they disassociate from me. By Him by Whom 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar swears, if one of them had the equivalent of Uhud in gold and spent it, Allah would not accept it from him until he believes in predestination." [Reported by Muslim]

### The Foundations of Their Belief

| Issue | Their Position |
|-------|----------------|
| Allah's Knowledge | Allah does not know things before they occur |
| Writing of Destiny | Nothing is written in the Preserved Tablet |
| Allah's Will | The servant is independent in his will |
| Creation of Actions | The servant creates his own actions |

### Their Refutation

#### From the Quran
1. {And with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them except Him. And He knows what is on the land and in the sea} [Al-An'am: 59]
2. {No disaster strikes upon the earth or among yourselves except that it is in a register before We bring it into being} [Al-Hadid: 22]

#### From the Sunnah
The Prophet ﷺ said: "Allah wrote the destinies of creation fifty thousand years before creating the heavens and the earth." [Reported by Muslim]

## Second Sect: The Jabriyyah

### Their Definition
They are those who exaggerated in affirming predestination to the point of denying the servant's action and choice, making man like a feather in the wind.

### Their Leader
**Jahm ibn Safwan** (d. 128H)

### The Foundations of Their Belief

| Issue | Their Position |
|-------|----------------|
| The Servant's Action | The servant has no real action |
| Choice | The servant is compelled, without choice |
| Reward and Punishment | Obligation is compulsion! (false consequence) |

### Their Refutation

#### From the Quran
1. {As a recompense for what they used to do} [As-Sajdah: 17] — Allah attributed the action to them
2. {Whoever wills, let him take a path to his Lord} [Al-Muzzammil: 19] — He affirmed their will
3. {It will have what it has earned, and it will bear what it has deserved} [Al-Baqarah: 286]

#### By Reason
1. **The difference between voluntary and involuntary movement** — Everyone distinguishes what they do by choice from what they are compelled to do
2. **Obligation without choice is injustice** — And Allah is free from injustice

## The Creed of Ahl as-Sunnah on Predestination

### The Four Levels of Predestination

\`\`\`
Levels of Belief in Predestination
├── Knowledge: Allah knows everything eternally
├── Writing: Everything is written in the Preserved Tablet
├── Will: What Allah wills is, what He does not will is not
└── Creation: Allah is Creator of everything including servants' actions
\`\`\`

### Reconciling Predestination and Free Will

Ahl as-Sunnah believe in:
1. **Allah's comprehensive decree** — Nothing escapes His decree
2. **The servant's real choice** — The servant acts by his choice and will
3. **The two wills do not conflict** — {And you do not will except that Allah wills} [Al-Insan: 30]

### Golden Rule
> "The servant truly acts, and Allah is the Creator of his action."

## Conclusion

| Sect | Position | Ruling |
|------|----------|--------|
| Qadariyyah | Denial of Allah's knowledge, writing and creation of actions | Manifest misguidance |
| Jabriyyah | Denial of the servant's action and choice | Manifest misguidance |
| Ahl as-Sunnah | Affirmation of predestination with affirmation of choice | The middle truth |
