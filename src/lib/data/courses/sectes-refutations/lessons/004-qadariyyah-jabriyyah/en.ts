> **"Allah wrote the destinies of creation fifty thousand years before creating the heavens and the earth."**
> — **The Prophet ﷺ** [Muslim 2653]

## 📖 Introduction

The question of **predestination** (al-qadar) is one of the deepest in Islamic theology. It touches upon Allah's nature, His knowledge, His will, and human responsibility.

Two groups went astray on this matter:
- **The Qadariyyah**: denied that human actions are created by Allah
- **The Jabriyyah**: denied that humans have real choice

Between them, **Ahl as-Sunnah** maintained the perfect balance.

## 📜 Part 1: The Importance of Believing in Predestination

### The Sixth Pillar of Faith

<div class="quote-box">

**The Hadith of Jibril:**

When Jibril عليه السلام asked the Prophet ﷺ: "What is faith?"

He replied: **"That you believe in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day, and that you believe in predestination, its good and its evil."**

[Muslim 8]

</div>

### The Four Levels of Predestination

| Level | Meaning | Proof |
|-------|---------|-------|
| **1. Knowledge (العلم)** | Allah knows everything eternally | ﴿Indeed, Allah is Knowing of all things﴾ |
| **2. Writing (الكتابة)** | Everything is written in the Preserved Tablet | ﴿And all things We have enumerated in a clear register﴾ |
| **3. Will (المشيئة)** | What Allah wills is, what He doesn't will isn't | ﴿And you do not will except that Allah wills﴾ |
| **4. Creation (الخلق)** | Allah is Creator of all things | ﴿Allah is the Creator of all things﴾ |

\`\`\`
The Four Levels of Predestination
├── 1️⃣ KNOWLEDGE (العلم)
│   ├── Allah knows everything
│   ├── Past, present and future
│   └── Nothing escapes Him
│
├── 2️⃣ WRITING (الكتابة)
│   ├── Everything is recorded
│   ├── In the Preserved Tablet
│   └── 50,000 years before creation
│
├── 3️⃣ WILL (المشيئة)
│   ├── What Allah wills happens
│   ├── What He doesn't will doesn't happen
│   └── Nothing escapes His will
│
└── 4️⃣ CREATION (الخلق)
    ├── Allah creates everything
    ├── Including the servants' actions
    └── He alone is the Creator

## ⚔️ Part 2: The Qadariyyah — Deniers of Predestination

### Definition

The Qadariyyah are those who **denied** that the servants' actions are predestined by Allah. They claim that man creates his own actions independently of Allah.

### The Founder: Ma'bad al-Juhani

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 SCENE: The Emergence of Destiny Denial — Basra, ~80 H**

*A circle of students listens to Ma'bad al-Juhani.*

**Ma'bad al-Juhani**: "Things occur without Allah having predestined them! Man is the creator of his own actions!"

**A student**: "But the Prophet ﷺ spoke of predestination in the hadith of Jibril!"

**Ma'bad**: "Allah does not know things before they occur. He discovers them when they happen!"

*This statement reaches the living Companions. They disavow him.*

</div>

### The Reaction of Ibn 'Umar

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 SCENE: Ibn 'Umar's Disavowal — Medina, ~80 H**

*A man comes to Ibn 'Umar رضي الله عنهما.*

**The man**: "Some people among us recite the Quran and seek knowledge, then they claim there is no predestination, and that matters occur spontaneously!"

**Ibn 'Umar** *(firmly)*: "When you meet these people, tell them that I disassociate from them and they disassociate from me!"

**The man**: "O Abu 'Abd ar-Rahman..."

**Ibn 'Umar**: "By Him by Whom 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar swears! If one of them possessed gold equal to Uhud and spent it, Allah would not accept it from him **until he believes in predestination**!"

*[Muslim 8]*

</div>

### Their False Beliefs

| Qadarite Belief | Refutation |
|-----------------|------------|
| "Allah doesn't know things before they happen" | ﴿And with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them except Him﴾ [Al-An'am: 59] |
| "Nothing is written in the Preserved Tablet" | ﴿No disaster strikes... except that it is in a register﴾ [Al-Hadid: 22] |
| "Man creates his own actions" | ﴿Allah is the Creator of all things﴾ [Az-Zumar: 62] |
| "Man's will is independent" | ﴿And you do not will except that Allah wills﴾ [Al-Insan: 30] |

### Their Severity

<div class="quote-box">

**The Prophet ﷺ said:**

**"القدرية مجوس هذه الأمة"**

**"The Qadariyyah are the Magians of this Ummah."**

[Abu Dawud 4691, Hasan]

**Why "Magians"?** The Zoroastrian Magians believe in two creators (of good and evil). The Qadariyyah do the same: they make man a creator alongside Allah!

## 🌀 Part 3: The Jabriyyah — Exaggeration in Predestination

### Definition

The Jabriyyah are those who **exaggerated** in affirming predestination to the point of denying that man has a will or real choice. For them, man is like **a feather in the wind** or **a dead leaf carried by the current**.

### The Leader: Jahm ibn Safwan

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 SCENE: The Doctrine of Compulsion — Transoxiana, ~120 H**

**Disciple**: "O Jahm, does man have a choice?"

**Jahm ibn Safwan**: "Man has no choice! He is compelled in all his actions. His movements are like trees moving in the wind!"

**Disciple**: "But then, why does Allah punish him?"

**Jahm**: "It is Allah's decree. Man is compelled, even in punishment."

**Disciple** *(perplexed)*: "If man has no choice, how can he be responsible?"

**Jahm**: "..."

</div>

### Their False Beliefs

| Jabrite Belief | Absurd Consequence |
|----------------|-------------------|
| "Man has no real action" | Then why does Allah say: ﴿A recompense for what they used to do﴾? |
| "Man has no choice" | Then why does Allah say: ﴿Whoever wills, let him believe﴾? |
| "Man is compelled" | Then punishing the compelled = **injustice** (and Allah is free from that) |
| "No difference between good and evil" | Annulment of morality and responsibility |

### The Absurdity of Their Position

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 SCENE: The Logical Test**

*A Sunni asks a Jabrite.*

**Sunni**: "According to you, man has no choice?"

**Jabrite**: "Exactly! Everything is compelled."

**Sunni**: "What difference do you make between raising your hand voluntarily and shivering from cold?"

**Jabrite**: "Uh... both are decreed by Allah."

**Sunni**: "But you yourself feel the difference! You know when you act by choice and when you're compelled. This awareness proves you have a choice!"

**Jabrite** *(silent)*: "..."

**Sunni**: "And if man truly had no choice, why would Allah send prophets? Why give commands to someone who cannot obey?"

</div>

### Refutation from the Quran

| Verse | Refutation |
|-------|------------|
| ﴿A recompense for what they used to do﴾ [As-Sajdah: 17] | Allah **attributed** the action to them |
| ﴿Whoever wills may take a path to his Lord﴾ [Al-Muzzammil: 19] | Allah affirmed their **will** |
| ﴿It will have what it earned, and it will bear what it deserved﴾ [Al-Baqarah: 286] | Allah attributed **acquisition** and **responsibility** to them |

## ⚖️ Part 4: The Position of Ahl as-Sunnah

### The Perfect Balance

<div class="quote-box">

**The Golden Rule:**

**"The servant truly acts, and Allah is the Creator of his action."**

Both are true:
- ✅ Allah has predestined everything and creates everything
- ✅ Man acts by his choice and will

</div>

### How to Reconcile?

| Question | Answer of Ahl as-Sunnah |
|----------|-------------------------|
| "If everything is predestined, why act?" | Predestination includes causes. Work is a cause of success. |
| "If Allah knew I would sin, can I avoid it?" | You don't know what Allah wrote. Act according to His command. |
| "Am I free or compelled?" | You're free in your choice, but your freedom itself is created by Allah. |

### The Final Comparative Table

| Aspect | Qadariyyah | Jabriyyah | Ahl as-Sunnah |
|--------|------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Allah's Knowledge** | ❌ Denied | ✅ Affirmed | ✅ Affirmed |
| **Writing of Destiny** | ❌ Denied | ✅ Affirmed | ✅ Affirmed |
| **Allah's Will** | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Absolute | ✅ Absolute |
| **Creation of Actions** | ❌ By man | ✅ By Allah alone | ✅ By Allah |
| **Man's Choice** | ✅ Affirmed | ❌ Denied | ✅ Affirmed |
| **Responsibility** | ✅ Affirmed | ❌ Absurd | ✅ Affirmed |

## 📖 Part 5: Dialogue with 'Umar ibn al-Khattab

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 SCENE: The Thief and Destiny — Medina, Era of 'Umar**

*A thief is brought before 'Umar رضي الله عنه.*

**'Umar**: "Why did you steal?"

**The thief** *(cunning)*: "It was Allah's destiny! It was written that I would steal!"

**'Umar** *(wisely)*: "Cut off his hand!"

**The thief**: "But it's destiny!"

**'Umar**: "Exactly! And my cutting your hand is **also** Allah's destiny! You cannot justify yourself with destiny, because punishment is also part of destiny!"

</div>

**Lesson**: One cannot use destiny as an excuse to disobey, because punishment is part of the same destiny.

## 🎯 Part 6: Contemporary Case Studies

### Case 1: "It's fate!"

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 SCENE: The Lazy Student — Today**

**Student** *(after failing)*: "It's fate! It was written that I would fail!"

**Teacher**: "Did you study?"

**Student**: "No, but if I was destined to succeed, I would have succeeded!"

**Teacher**: "Destiny includes **causes**. Studying is a cause of success. You didn't implement the cause, so you didn't get the result. That's the real destiny!"

</div>

**Rule**: ✅ Destiny does not exempt from taking causes. Trust in Allah accompanies effort.

---

### Case 2: "If Allah knew I would sin..."

**Situation**: Someone says: "If Allah knew I would sin, why punish me? It's not my fault!"

| Response |
|----------|
| 1. You **don't know** what Allah wrote for you |
| 2. You **chose** to sin — no one forced you |
| 3. Allah's knowledge doesn't **cause** your action |
| 4. Destiny doesn't **remove** responsibility |

---

### Case 3: Destructive Fatalism

**Situation**: A sick person refuses treatment saying: "If Allah wants to heal me, He will heal me!"

<div class="quote-box">

**The Prophet ﷺ said:**

**"تداووا عباد الله، فإن الله لم يضع داء إلا وضع له شفاء"**

**"Seek treatment, O servants of Allah! For Allah has not created a disease without creating a cure for it."**

[Abu Dawud 3855, Sahih]

</div>

**Rule**: ✅ Seeking treatment is a **cause** that destiny includes. Refusing causes is not trust, it's negligence.

---

### Case 4: "I was born this way!"

**Situation**: Someone justifies their sins saying: "It's my nature, Allah created me this way!"

| Response |
|----------|
| 1. Allah also created you with the **ability to choose** |
| 2. He sent you **prophets** and **guides** |
| 3. Inclinations are not **excuses** |
| 4. Fighting desires is **rewarded** |
