## Introduction

The Asha'irah and Maturidiyyah are the two largest theological sects spread throughout the Muslim world, and many Muslims today affiliate with them.

---

## First Sect: The Asha'irah

### Definition and Origin
- **Founder**: Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari (260-324H)
- **He was a Mu'tazilite** then returned to the Sunnah
- **The stages of his doctrinal life**:
  1. Mu'tazilism (40 years)
  2. The school of Ibn Kullab (transitional phase)
  3. The school of Ahl as-Sunnah (end of his life)

### The Books of Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari
| Phase | Books |
|-------|-------|
| Intermediate phase | Al-Luma', Letter to the Frontier People |
| Final phase | Al-Ibanah 'an Usul ad-Diyanah, Maqalat al-Islamiyyin |

### The Evolution of the Ash'arite School

The Asha'irah did not remain as al-Ash'ari was, but the school evolved:

\`\`\`
Phases of Ash'arite Evolution
├── Al-Ash'ari: Close to Ahl as-Sunnah in many issues
├── Al-Baqillani and al-Juwayni: Expansion of speculative theology
├── Al-Ghazali: Introduction of Sufism
└── Ar-Razi and al-Amidi: Influenced by philosophy
\`\`\`

### The Foundations of the Asha'irah

#### 1. The Seven Attributes
- They only affirm seven attributes: Life, Knowledge, Power, Will, Hearing, Sight, Speech
- They deny or allegorically interpret the others

#### 2. Allegorical Interpretation of Allah's Attributes
| Attribute | Their Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------------|
| The Hand | Blessing or power |
| The Face | The essence |
| The Establishment (Istawa) | Domination |
| The Descent | Descent of His command or mercy |

#### 3. The Quran
- The inner speech (nafsiyyah) is eternal
- The letters and words are created

#### 4. Faith
- Heart's belief only
- Actions are not part of faith

### Critique of the Ash'arite School

1. **Contradiction with the Salaf's methodology** in the chapter of attributes
2. **Lack of consistency** in affirming some attributes and denying others
3. **Al-Ash'ari's own return** to the school of Ahl as-Sunnah

## Second Sect: The Maturidiyyah

### Definition and Origin
- **Founder**: Abu Mansur al-Maturidi (d. 333H)
- **The attribution**: To Maturid, a village near Samarkand
- **Propagation**: Transoxiana, India, Turkey

### The Foundations of the Maturidiyyah

They agree with the Asha'irah in many issues, and differ in others:

| Issue | Asha'irah | Maturidiyyah |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Number of attributes | 7 | 8 (add at-Takwin) |
| Allah's actions | Without cause | Motivated by wisdom |
| Good and evil | Revelation only | Reason |
| Faith | Belief | Belief and declaration |

### Critique of the Maturidiyyah

1. **Allegorical interpretation of attributes** like the Asha'irah
2. **Mixing** between the Salaf's methodology and speculative theology
3. **Contradiction** in some principles

## The Position of Ahl as-Sunnah

### The Required Fairness
1. **Acknowledge their merit** in refuting the Mu'tazilah and philosophers
2. **Show their errors** in the chapter of attributes
3. **Not generalizing innovation** on their personalities without detail

### Conclusion
> The Asha'irah and Maturidiyyah are not from Ahl as-Sunnah in the chapter of attributes, but they are closer to the Sunnah than the Mu'tazilah and Jahmiyyah.
