## Introduction

The Asha'irah and Maturidiyyah are the two largest theological sects spread throughout the Muslim world, and many Muslims today affiliate with them.

---

## First Sect: The Asha'irah

### Definition and Origin
- **Founder**: Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari (260-324H)
- **He was a Mu'tazilite** then returned to the Sunnah
- **The stages of his doctrinal life**:
  1. Mu'tazilism (40 years)
  2. The school of Ibn Kullab (transitional phase)
  3. The school of Ahl as-Sunnah (end of his life)

### The Books of Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari
| Phase | Books |
|-------|-------|
| Intermediate phase | Al-Luma', Letter to the Frontier People |
| Final phase | Al-Ibanah 'an Usul ad-Diyanah, Maqalat al-Islamiyyin |

### The Evolution of the Ash'arite School

The Asha'irah did not remain as al-Ash'ari was, but the school evolved:

\`\`\`
Phases of Ash'arite Evolution
├── Al-Ash'ari: Close to Ahl as-Sunnah in many issues
├── Al-Baqillani and al-Juwayni: Expansion of speculative theology
├── Al-Ghazali: Introduction of Sufism
└── Ar-Razi and al-Amidi: Influenced by philosophy
\`\`\`

### The Foundations of the Asha'irah

#### 1. The Seven Attributes
- They only affirm seven attributes: Life, Knowledge, Power, Will, Hearing, Sight, Speech
- They deny or allegorically interpret the others

#### 2. Allegorical Interpretation of Allah's Attributes
| Attribute | Their Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------------|
| The Hand | Blessing or power |
| The Face | The essence |
| The Establishment (Istawa) | Domination |
| The Descent | Descent of His command or mercy |

#### 3. The Quran
- The inner speech (nafsiyyah) is eternal
- The letters and words are created

#### 4. Faith
- Heart's belief only
- Actions are not part of faith

### Critique of the Ash'arite School

1. **Contradiction with the Salaf's methodology** in the chapter of attributes
2. **Lack of consistency** in affirming some attributes and denying others
3. **Al-Ash'ari's own return** to the school of Ahl as-Sunnah

---

## Second Sect: The Maturidiyyah

### Definition and Origin
- **Founder**: Abu Mansur al-Maturidi (d. 333H)
- **The attribution**: To Maturid, a village near Samarkand
- **Propagation**: Transoxiana, India, Turkey

### The Foundations of the Maturidiyyah

They agree with the Asha'irah in many issues, and differ in others:

| Issue | Asha'irah | Maturidiyyah |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Number of attributes | 7 | 8 (add at-Takwin) |
| Allah's actions | Without cause | Motivated by wisdom |
| Good and evil | Revelation only | Reason |
| Faith | Belief | Belief and declaration |

### Critique of the Maturidiyyah

1. **Allegorical interpretation of attributes** like the Asha'irah
2. **Mixing** between the Salaf's methodology and speculative theology
3. **Contradiction** in some principles

## The Position of Ahl as-Sunnah

### The Required Fairness
1. **Acknowledge their merit** in refuting the Mu'tazilah and philosophers
2. **Show their errors** in the chapter of attributes
3. **Not generalizing innovation** on their personalities without detail

### Conclusion
> The Asha'irah and Maturidiyyah are not from Ahl as-Sunnah in the chapter of attributes, but they are closer to the Sunnah than the Mu'tazilah and Jahmiyyah.

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf: The Repentance of Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari

Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari was upon the Mu'tazilite school for forty years, then something occurred that changed his course.

It is reported that he saw the Prophet ﷺ in a dream three times during Ramadan, commanding him to support what was reported from him. He then secluded himself in his house for fifteen days, reflecting.

Then he went to the main mosque of Basra, ascended the pulpit on Friday and said:

*"O people! I was absent from you for this period because I examined and the evidences became equal to me, nothing prevailing over another. So I sought Allah's guidance and He guided me to what I deposited in these books. I have stripped myself of all I used to believe, as I strip myself of this garment."*

He removed a garment he was wearing and threw it, and handed the people his books.

**Lesson learned**: Returning to the truth is a virtue, and the truthful scholar follows the evidence even if it contradicts what he was raised upon.

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases: Dealing with the Asha'irah and Maturidiyyah

### Case 1: Excommunicating the Asha'irah
Someone says: *"The Asha'irah are disbelievers because they interpret the attributes!"*

**Question**: Should the Asha'irah be excommunicated?

**Answer**: ❌ Absolutely not. The Asha'irah are innovators in the chapter of attributes and are not disbelievers. Many of their scholars have great contributions in serving Islam.

---

### Case 2: Tafsir Books
A student asks: *"Should I read Ibn Kathir's tafsir or az-Zamakhshari's al-Kashshaf?"*

**Question**: How do we deal with books of opponents?

**Answer**: ✅ Both have benefits. However, Ibn Kathir's tafsir is upon the methodology of Ahl as-Sunnah, while al-Kashshaf contains Mu'tazilite ideas one should be aware of. The student of knowledge benefits from all while discerning.

---

### Case 3: Allah's Attributes
A mosque imam says: *"'Istawa 'ala al-'Arsh' means dominated, because real establishment necessitates anthropomorphism!"*

**Question**: Is this interpretation correct?

**Answer**: ❌ No. This is the interpretation of the Asha'irah. The methodology of the Salaf: Affirming real establishment (Istiwa') for Allah تعالى as befits His Majesty, without asking how or likening to creation.

---

### Case 4: Al-'Aqidah at-Tahawiyyah
Someone asks: *"Is al-'Aqidah at-Tahawiyyah Ash'ari or Salafi?"*

**Question**: What is the methodology of al-'Aqidah at-Tahawiyyah?

**Answer**: ✅ Al-'Aqidah at-Tahawiyyah is upon the methodology of Ahl as-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah, even though Imam at-Tahawi was Hanafi. What matters is the content, not the affiliation.

---

### Case 5: Fairness with Opponents
A student of knowledge says: *"I will not benefit from any Ash'ari scholar, they are all misguided!"*

**Question**: Should we reject all the knowledge of opponents?

**Answer**: ❌ No. It is unjust to reject all their knowledge. Ibn Hajar and an-Nawawi were Ash'ari and have great contributions in serving the Sunnah. We take the truth and reject the falsehood.

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

**Personal question**: Do you understand the creed of the Salaf regarding Allah's attributes correctly? Or do you need to review it?

**Remember:**
- Affirm for Allah what He affirmed for Himself without distortion or denial
- Do not liken Allah's attributes to the attributes of creation
- Be fair with scholars who err in some issues
- The Asha'irah and Maturidiyyah are our brothers in Islam even if they erred in some attributes
