## Introduction

After studying the main sects, their beliefs and deviations, this final lesson presents **the scientific and ethical methodology** with which the scholars of Ahl as-Sunnah refute opponents — combining justice, knowledge, and wisdom.

# Part 1: Methodological Foundations

## ⚖️ First Foundation: Justice and Equity

<div class="quote-box">

**Allah تعالى says**:
> ﴾And let not the hatred of a people incite you to be unjust. Be just; that is nearer to piety﴿ [Al-Ma'idah: 8]

**The principle**: Our disagreement with a sect does not authorize us to wrong them.

</div>

### Practical Applications of Justice

| Rule | Application |
|------|-------------|
| **Acknowledge truth from the opponent** | If a Mu'tazilite says something true, we accept it |
| **Don't deny his good deeds** | His errors don't erase his merits |
| **Don't attribute to him what he didn't say** | Quote exactly, don't distort |
| **Don't generalize** | Not all individuals of a sect share the same excesses |

---

## 🔍 Second Foundation: Distinguishing the Statement from the Speaker

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Scene 1: Imam Ahmad and the Capital Nuance**

**Baghdad — After the Mihna**

*A student questions Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal about the Jahmiyyah.*

**The student**: O Imam, you said that the statement "the Quran is created" is disbelief. Does this mean everyone who said it is a disbeliever?

**Imam Ahmad** *(with wisdom)*: The statement is disbelief. But the one who utters it may be ignorant, or have an erroneous interpretation, or be coerced.

**The student**: So how do we judge?

**Imam Ahmad**: We establish the proof against him. If he persists after understanding, then yes. Otherwise, we consider him misguided, not a disbeliever.

</div>

### Table of Distinction

| The Statement | The One Who Utters It |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Judged in itself | May be excused by ignorance or interpretation |
| May be disbelief | Doesn't automatically imply the disbelief of its author |
| Absolutely false | The ruling on the individual requires fulfillment of conditions |

## 📖 Third Foundation: Refute with Proof, Not Insults

<div class="quote-box">

**The Prophet ﷺ said**:
> "Whoever possesses these four traits is a pure hypocrite, and whoever possesses one of them has a trait of hypocrisy until he abandons it: when entrusted, he betrays; when he speaks, he lies; when he promises, he breaks it; and when he disputes, he transgresses."
[Al-Bukhari & Muslim]

**The principle**: "When he disputes, he transgresses" — The believer doesn't transgress limits, even in disagreement.

</div>

### Types of Proofs in Refutation

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Textual proofs** | Quran, authentic Sunnah, Consensus (Ijma') |
| **Rational proofs** | Showing the logical contradictions of the opponent |
| **Factual proofs** | Their practice contradicts their theory |

### The Method of Confrontation (Ilzam)

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Scene 2: Ilzam — Making the Opponent Fall into His Own Contradiction**

**Dialogue between a Sunni and a Jahmite**

**Jahmite**: Allah is not above the Throne. "Above" implies direction, and Allah is exempt from direction.

**Sunni**: Very well. Allah تعالى says: ﴾The Most Merciful established Himself above the Throne﴿ [Ta-Ha: 5]. Do you deny this verse?

**Jahmite**: No, but I interpret it. "Established Himself" means "dominated."

**Sunni**: And the verses where Allah says He "hears" and "sees" — do you interpret those too?

**Jahmite**: Uh... no, those we take literally.

**Sunni**: What's the difference? Why accept "hears" and "sees" literally, but not "established"? Your criterion is arbitrary.

*The Jahmite finds no coherent answer.*

</div>

## 📊 Fourth Foundation: Respect the Levels of Divergence

| Level | Description | Attitude | Example |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| 🟢 **Branches (Furu')** | Between juridical schools | No boycott or accusation of innovation | Number of rak'at in Witr |
| 🟡 **Light innovation** | Doesn't touch the foundations | Clarification with discretion | Certain dhikr formulas |
| 🟠 **Grave innovation** | Touches the foundations of creed | Warning and boycott if necessary | Denying the Attributes, excommunicating the Companions |
| 🔴 **Explicit disbelief** | Contradiction of the foundations of Islam | Disavowal and complete cutting off | Wahdat al-Wujud, claiming prophethood |

---

# Part 2: Manners in Refutation

## 🎯 1. Sincerity to Allah

<div class="quote-box">

**The criterion**:
> The goal is to support the **Truth**, not personal triumph.

**Questions to ask yourself before refuting**:
- Am I refuting for Allah or for my ego?
- Would I be happy if the opponent repents?
- Would I accept the truth if it came from him?

</div>

---

## 🎯 2. Knowledge of What You're Refuting

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Scene 3: The Fatal Error — Refuting Without Understanding**

**Dialogue between two students**

**Student A**: I wrote a refutation of the Ash'ariyyah!

**Student B**: Good. What exactly did you refute?

**Student A**: Their belief that the Quran is created!

**Student B**: But... the Ash'ariyyah don't say the Quran is created. They distinguish between the eternal Speech and the "revealed" Quran. You're confusing them with the Mu'tazilah.

**Student A** *(embarrassed)*: Ah...

**Student B**: You just attributed to them something they didn't say. That's injustice, and it weakens your refutation.

</div>

**Golden Rule**: Understand the opponent's position well before refuting it.

---

## 🎯 3. Wisdom and Gradual Approach

<div class="quote-box">

**Allah تعالى says**:
> ﴾Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best﴿ [An-Nahl: 125]

</div>

### The Stages of Advice

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1. 🤫 **Private advice** | First in private, with gentleness |
| ⬇️ | |
| 2. 📢 **Public denunciation** | If private advice is not enough, when the error is publicly spread |
| ⬇️ | |
| 3. 🚫 **Warning and boycott** | If the opponent persists in misguidance, to protect the Muslims |

# Part 3: Examples from the Salaf

## 📜 Ibn 'Abbas and the Khawarij

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Scene 4: The Legendary Debate at Harura**

**Harura, near Kufa — 37 H**

*The Khawarij have gathered, armed, threatening to revolt against 'Ali رضي الله عنه. The Caliph hesitates: fight them immediately or attempt dialogue?*

**'Ali**: Ibn 'Abbas, go to them and debate with them.

**Ibn 'Abbas** *(preparing)*: With pleasure, O Commander of the Believers.

*Ibn 'Abbas puts on his finest Yemeni garments and goes to the Khawarij camp.*

**A Kharijite**: What do you want, cousin of the Prophet ﷺ?

**Ibn 'Abbas**: I come to question you. What do you hold against the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet ﷺ?

**The Khawarij**: Three things:
1. He accepted the arbitration of men in Allah's judgment!
2. He fought without taking booty or captives!
3. He erased his title "Commander of the Believers" at Siffin!

**Ibn 'Abbas**: If I answer you with the Quran and Sunnah, will you accept?

**The Khawarij**: Yes!

**Ibn 'Abbas**: 
1. On arbitration: Allah ordered arbitration between spouses: ﴾Send an arbitrator from his family and an arbitrator from her family﴿. If arbitration is permitted between spouses, all the more so to spare Muslim blood!

2. On the booty: Did you want him to take 'A'ishah, Mother of the Believers, as a captive? She is your mother by the Quran!

3. On the title: The Prophet ﷺ himself erased "Messenger of Allah" from the Treaty of Hudaybiya when the Quraysh requested it.

*Silence among the Khawarij. Two thousand of them repent and return to obedience to 'Ali.*

</div>

**The lesson**: Dialogue before combat. Proofs before weapons.

## 📜 Imam Ahmad Facing the Jahmiyyah

| Aspect | What he did |
|--------|-------------|
| **Endurance** | Endured the trial and torture without retreating |
| **Knowledge** | Refuted with the Quran and Sunnah, not emotion |
| **Justice** | Excommunicated their statements without excommunicating all their individuals |
| **Firmness** | Never compromised on creed |

---

## 📜 Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah

<div class="quote-box">

**His encyclopedic approach**:
- Refuted the Jahmiyyah, Ash'ariyyah, Mu'tazilah, Shi'ah, extreme Sufis, Philosophers, Christians...
- Combined **depth** (detailed arguments) and **comprehensiveness** (all sects)
- Was **just** with his adversaries despite their injustice toward him

**What he said**:
> "We do not hasten to excommunicate the ignorant, even if he says a word of disbelief, until we establish the proof against him."

</div>

# Part 4: Errors to Avoid

## ❌ Common Errors in Refutation

| Error | Correction |
|-------|------------|
| **Takfir without rules** | Distinguish between the statement and the one who utters it |
| **Injustice** | Remain just even with the opponent |
| **Ignorance** | Understand well before refuting |
| **Excessive harshness** | Wisdom and good instruction |
| **Insults** | Refute with proof, not curses |
| **Haste** | Verify before judging |
| **Generalization** | Don't put all followers at the same level |

---

## ⚠️ Warning Against Laxity

<div class="quote-box">

**The necessary balance**:

Justice doesn't mean **weakness**:
- ✅ Clarity in exposing the truth
- ✅ Firmness in judging false statements
- ✅ Clear warning against misguidance
- ❌ No complaisance at the expense of creed

**Ibn al-Qayyim said**:
> "The truth doesn't need violence, but it doesn't need weakness either."

</div>
