# Part 2: Causes and Motivations

## 📜 Scene 1: The Story of a Young Muslim

<div class="scene-box">

**Western University, 21st Century**

*Ahmed, a first-year Muslim student, sits in a philosophy lecture.*

**Professor**: If God exists and is all-powerful and all-good, why does evil exist in the world?

*Ahmed hesitates... he was never taught how to answer.*

**Professor**: This is called "the problem of evil." Either God doesn't exist, or He's not capable, or He's not good.

*After months, Ahmed gradually loses his faith...*

**Ahmed's Friend**: What happened to you?

**Ahmed**: I can't believe in a God who allows all this suffering...

## ⚠️ Main Causes of Atheism

### First: Intellectual Causes

| Objection | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **The problem of evil** | How does evil coexist with a merciful and all-powerful God? |
| **Scientism** | Believing that science explains everything without need for a Creator |
| **Theory of evolution** | Believing it makes the Creator unnecessary |
| **Plurality of religions** | If religions are multiple, they're all false! |

### Second: Psychological Causes

| Cause | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Bad experience with religion** | Harsh parents, hypocrisy of religious people |
| **Desire for freedom** | Getting rid of moral "constraints" |
| **Pride** | Refusal to submit to any authority |
| **Social pressure** | In an atheist environment |

### Third: Moral Causes

| Cause | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Rejection of religious laws** | Especially those related to sexuality and women |
| **Anger at God** | Due to personal tragedy |

# Part 3: Response to Objections

## 🛡️ Response to the Problem of Evil

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Scene 2: The Wisdom Behind Trials**

**Atheist**: If God existed and was merciful, there would be no pain, disease, or injustice!

**Muslim**: Good question. Let me ask you: Is the surgeon who performs a painful operation cruel or merciful?

**Atheist**: Merciful, because he wants to heal.

**Muslim**: Exactly! Allah created this world as an abode of trial, not pure bliss. Pain has wisdoms:

| Wisdom | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Trial** | To test the patience of servants |
| **Expiation** | To erase sins |
| **Elevation** | To raise ranks |
| **Reminder** | To return to Allah |
| **Education** | To develop virtues like patience and compassion |

**Muslim**: The injustice done by humans is the result of their freedom that Allah gave them. Without freedom, humans would have no value.

## 🛡️ Response to Scientism

<div class="quote-box">

**The Fundamental Error:**

Science answers **"how"** things work, not **"why"** they exist.

| Question | Science | Religion |
|----------|---------|----------|
| How does a planet move? | ✅ Gravity | — |
| Why does the universe exist? | ❌ Doesn't answer | ✅ Allah created it with wisdom |
| What is the meaning of life? | ❌ Doesn't answer | ✅ Worshipping Allah |
| What is good and evil? | ❌ Doesn't define | ✅ Divine Law |

**Science and religion don't oppose each other; they complement each other.**

</div>

## 🛡️ Response to the Evolution Objection

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Scene 3: Dialogue on Evolution**

**Atheist**: The theory of evolution proved that man evolved from apes without needing a Creator!

**Muslim**: Let's distinguish several things:

| Concept | Position |
|---------|----------|
| **Micro-evolution** (small changes within a species) | ✅ Scientifically observed |
| **Macro-evolution** (one species transforms into another) | ⚠️ Theory without definitive proof |
| **The origin of man from Adam** | ✅ Established Islamic belief |

**Muslim**: And even if we assume the validity of full evolution, who established the laws of evolution? Who created the first cell? Blind chance doesn't produce order!

**Atheist**: Nature...

**Muslim**: Nature is not a conscious agent. You just replaced the word "Allah" with the word "nature"!

</div>

# Part 4: Proofs of Allah's Existence

## 📜 Rational Proofs

### 1. The Proof of Creation

> Allah says: ﴾Were they created from nothing, or are they the creators? Did they create the heavens and the earth? No, they are not certain.﴿ [At-Tur: 35-36]

<div class="quote-box">

**Jubayr ibn Mut'im said:**

I heard the Prophet ﷺ recite this verse, and my heart nearly flew away! And I was then a polytheist.

**Logical Analysis:**

| Possibility | Judgment |
|-------------|----------|
| They came from nothing | ❌ Rationally impossible |
| They created themselves | ❌ Impossible (how can the non-existent create itself?) |
| A Creator created them | ✅ The only possibility |

</div>

### 2. The Proof of Precision and Design

> Allah says: ﴾This is the work of Allah, who has perfected everything.﴿ [An-Naml: 88]

<div class="quote-box">

**Examples from the Universe:**

| Phenomenon | Precision |
|------------|-----------|
| **A single cell** | Contains information filling 1000 encyclopedias |
| **The human eye** | 130 million light-sensitive cells |
| **Cosmic constants** | If they changed by 1%, life wouldn't exist |
| **The water cycle** | A complete integrated system |

**It's inconceivable that blind chance produced all this precision!**

</div>

### 3. The Proof of Fitra (Innate Nature)

> The Prophet ﷺ said: "Every newborn is born on the fitra; it is their parents who make them Jewish, Christian, or Magian." [Al-Bukhari]

<div class="quote-box">

**Fitra = The innate disposition to believe**

| Observation | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| Humans turn to a "higher power" in adversity | Faith is ingrained in them |
| All civilizations believed in a god | It's not coincidence |
| Children ask "Who made this?" | The sound fitra |
| Atheism requires teaching, faith is innate | Proof of faith's authenticity |

</div>

# Part 5: How to Deal with Atheists?

## 📋 The Correct Methodology

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Wisdom and good exhortation** | Don't insult or belittle |
| **Understand the real cause** | Is it an intellectual objection or psychological problem? |
| **Gradual approach** | Start with what's most important |
| **Sincerity** | Want to guide them, not defeat them |
| **Supplication** | Guidance is in Allah's hands |

---

## 📜 Scene 4: A Successful Dialogue

<div class="scene-box">

**A Muslim meets a former atheist who returned to faith**

**Muslim**: What brought you back to Islam?

**The Repentant**: Three things:

1. **A sincere Muslim** who treated me with respect without declaring me a disbeliever
2. **Real questions** he asked me: Where did the universe come from? What is the meaning of your life?
3. **The inner void** — Atheism didn't give me peace

**The Repentant**: I realized that atheism doesn't offer answers; it takes them away. No meaning, no purpose, no stable morality.

**Muslim**: Praise be to Allah for your guidance.

</div>

---

## ⚠️ Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why is it a mistake? |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Declaring them disbeliever directly** | They might be ignorant or have a misinterpretation |
| **Mockery and insults** | Pushes them further away |
| **Sterile debate** | Without knowledge, it harms |
| **Despairing of them** | Guidance is always in Allah's hands |

# Part 6: Protecting the Youth

## 📋 How to Protect Our Children?

| Method | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Teach creed early** | With age-appropriate methods |
| **Answer their questions** | Don't ignore their inquiries |
| **Build trust** | So they talk to us about their doubts |
| **Familiarize them with objections in advance** | With their answers, before they hear them from others |
| **Virtuous example** | A Muslim balanced intellectually and behaviorally |

---

# Part 7: Atheism and Morality

## 📜 Scene 5: Where Does Morality Come From?

<div class="scene-box">

**Dialogue on Morality**

**Muslim**: If there is no God, where does morality come from?

**Atheist**: From evolution and society!

**Muslim**: So morality is relative and changes with society?

**Atheist**: Yes...

**Muslim**: Then why do you criticize "injustice"? Maybe in another society, injustice is "good"!

**Atheist** *(silent)*...

**Muslim**: Without a stable reference (God), there is no real good and evil. Just opinions!

</div>

---

## 📊 Comparison: Islam vs Atheism

| Question | Islam | Atheism |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Where do you come from?** | Allah created you | Blind chance |
| **Why are you here?** | To worship Allah | No meaning |
| **Where are you going?** | Paradise or Hell | Nothingness |
| **What is good and evil?** | What Allah commands and forbids | Relative and changing |
| **What is man's value?** | Allah's vicegerent on earth | Evolved animal |

---

## 💡 Reflection

### Questions for the Atheist

- If the universe has no meaning, why do you search for meaning?
- If your thoughts are the result of random chemical reactions, why do you trust them?
- If there is no life after death, why do you care about anything?
- Doesn't it bother you that the oppressor and the oppressed will end up with the same fate: nothingness?
