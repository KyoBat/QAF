## Preamble: The Importance of Studying Sects

The study of Islamic sects is among the essential sciences for the student of knowledge, for several reasons:

### 1. The Prophetic Command to Know Evil to Guard Against It

Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman رضي الله عنه said: "The people used to ask the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about the good, and I used to ask him about evil fearing it would reach me." [Agreed upon]

### 2. The Hadith of Division

Abu Hurayrah رضي الله عنه reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: "The Jews divided into seventy-one groups, the Christians divided into seventy-two groups, and my nation will divide into seventy-three groups." [Reported by Abu Dawud and at-Tirmidhi]

## Definition of Sect (Firqah)

### Linguistic Meaning
Firqah: From the root "faraqa" meaning to separate two things.

### Technical Meaning
It is the group that contradicted Ahl as-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah in one or more fundamentals of the religion.

## The Criterion for Distinguishing Between Sects

### Types of Disagreement

| Type of Disagreement | Ruling | Example |
|---------------------|--------|---------|
| Disagreement in branches (furu') | Does not cause separation | Jurists' differences in matters of ijtihad |
| Disagreement in fundamentals (usul) | Causes separation | Denying Allah's attributes or rejecting predestination |

### The Standard Defining a Sect
> A deviant sect is one that contradicted the methodology of Ahl as-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah in a fundamental of creed in a way that excludes it from their path.

## The Methodology of Ahl as-Sunnah in Dealing with Sects

### 1. Justice and Fairness
- Do not wrong anyone
- Acknowledge truth even from opponents
- Reject falsehood even from affiliates

### 2. Distinguishing Between the Statement and the One Who Makes It
- The false statement is absolutely false
- The speaker may be excused due to ignorance or misinterpretation

### 3. Refuting with Evidence and Proof
- Evidence from the Quran and Sunnah
- Confronting the opponent with the logical consequences of his statements
- Exposing contradictions in his school of thought

## Causes of the Emergence of Sects

### Internal Causes
1. **Extremism (ghuluw)** — Excessive rigidity in religion
2. **Negligence (jafa')** — Laxity and carelessness
3. **Following desires** — Prioritizing opinion over revelation
4. **Fanaticism** — Blind following of ancestors, schools, or personalities

### External Causes
1. **Infiltration of foreign ideas** — From Greek and Persian philosophies
2. **Jewish infiltration** — Like 'Abdullah ibn Saba'
3. **Political turmoil** — Like the fitnah of 'Uthman's assassination رضي الله عنه

## General Classification of Sects

### Theological Sects (regarding attributes)
- Jahmiyyah
- Mu'tazilah
- Asha'irah
- Maturidiyyah

### Sects on Predestination
- Qadariyyah
- Jabriyyah

### Sects on Faith
- Murji'ah
- Khawarij

### Sects on Leadership
- Shi'a and its branches
- Ibadiyyah

## Goals of This Series

1. Introduce each sect: its origin and causes of emergence
2. Explain its foundations and major beliefs
3. Refute it through scriptural and rational proofs
4. Clarify the position of Ahl as-Sunnah on each issue
5. Draw lessons and insights

## Conclusion

> The study of sects is not for sectarianism or excommunication, but to distinguish truth from falsehood, and to preserve the purity of creed.

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf: Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman — The Keeper of the Prophet's Secret ﷺ

Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman رضي الله عنه was called "the Keeper of the Secret" because the Prophet ﷺ had informed him of the names of the hypocrites. While people would ask the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about the good, Hudhayfah would ask him about evil, fearing it would reach him.

Hudhayfah said: *"O Messenger of Allah, we were in ignorance and evil, then Allah brought us this good. Will there be evil after this good?"* He said: **"Yes."** I asked: *"And will there be good after that evil?"* He said: **"Yes, but with impurity."** I asked: *"What is its impurity?"* He said: **"People who guide by other than my guidance, you will recognize some and disapprove of others."** [Agreed upon]

**Lesson learned**: Knowledge of sects and deviations is not for arrogance, but for protection and prevention. Whoever knows evil guards against it, and whoever is ignorant of it falls into it.

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### Case 1: The New Da'i
A young man studied religious knowledge then began classifying people and issuing declarations of innovation on everyone who disagrees with him on any issue.

**Question**: Is this the methodology of Ahl as-Sunnah in dealing with opponents?

**Answer**: ❌ No. The methodology of Ahl as-Sunnah is based on justice and fairness, distinguishing between the statement and the one who makes it, and verification before judgment. Innovation labels are not issued based on whims but on sound legal criteria.

---

### Case 2: Ignorance of Sects
A Muslim says: *"Why should we study sects? What matters is that we're Muslims, there's no need for these classifications!"*

**Question**: Can we ignore the study of sects?

**Answer**: ❌ No. Studying sects is a religious necessity to protect creed. 'Umar رضي الله عنه said: *"The bonds of Islam are undone one by one when people grow up in Islam without knowing Jahiliyyah."*

---

### Case 3: Jurisprudential Disagreement
Someone says: *"The disagreement about raising hands in prayer is like the disagreement about Allah's attributes — both create sects!"*

**Question**: Is disagreement in branches like disagreement in fundamentals?

**Answer**: ❌ No. Disagreement in jurisprudential branches of ijtihad does not create sects, whereas disagreement in fundamentals of creed is what excludes from the methodology of Ahl as-Sunnah.

---

### Case 4: Attitude Toward Scholars
A student of knowledge is reading a book by a famous Ash'ari scholar, and his colleague says: *"Don't read from him! He's an innovator!"*

**Question**: How do we deal with the legacy of scholars who erred in some issues?

**Answer**: ✅ We distinguish between persons and statements. We benefit from their knowledge where they were correct, and clarify their errors where they were wrong, with fairness and without diminishing their rights.

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

**Personal question**: Do you truly know what you believe? Or did you inherit your creed without deep understanding?

**Remember:**
- Knowing the truth requires serious pursuit of knowledge
- Knowing falsehood protects you from falling into it
- Justice is required even with opponents
- Classification is not for arrogance but for distinction and protection
