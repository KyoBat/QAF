## 📖 Introduction

The Khawarij are **the first sect** to divide the Ummah and spill Muslim blood. Their story is an eternal warning against the dangers of religious extremism and hasty excommunication (takfir).

They killed **the fourth of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs**, 'Ali ibn Abi Talib رضي الله عنه. Their ideology has reappeared throughout history in various forms, even in our present age.

## 📚 Part 3: Their Core Beliefs

### 1. Excommunication of Major Sin Committers

## ⚡ Part 4: The Prophetic Description

### Hadiths About the Khawarij

The Prophet ﷺ described the Khawarij with astonishing precision, **years before they appeared**:

| Hadith | Source | Characteristic |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| "They recite the Quran but it does not go beyond their throats" | Bukhari/Muslim | Worship without understanding |
| "They pass through the religion as an arrow passes through its prey" | Bukhari/Muslim | Swift exit from Islam |
| "Foolish minds, young in age" | Bukhari/Muslim | Youth and hastiness |
| "Their mark is shaved heads" | Bukhari/Muslim | Distinguishing sign |
| "They speak the best words of creation" | Bukhari/Muslim | Good speech, bad actions |
| "They kill the people of Islam and leave the idol worshippers" | Bukhari/Muslim | Target: Muslims |

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Scene: The First Kharijite — The Prophetic Era**

*The Prophet ﷺ is distributing spoils. A man approaches.*

**Dhu al-Khuwaysira**: "O Muhammad, be just!"

**The Prophet ﷺ** *(astonished)*: "Woe to you! Who would be just if I am not just? You are indeed doomed and lost if I am not just."

**'Umar** *(angrily)*: "O Messenger of Allah, permit me to strike his neck!"

**The Prophet ﷺ**: "Leave him. He has companions whom one of you would belittle his prayer compared to their prayer, and his fasting compared to their fasting. They recite the Quran but it does not go beyond their throats. They pass through the religion as an arrow passes through its prey."

*[Bukhari 3610, Muslim 1064]*

## 🗡️ Part 5: Branches of the Khawarij

### Historical Classification

| Sect | Founder | Distinctive Feature | Extremism Level |
|------|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Muhakkimah** | The first | Origin of the Khawarij | ⚠️⚠️⚠️ |
| **Azariqah** | Nafi' ibn al-Azraq (d. 65H) | Kill women and children of dissenters | 🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴 |
| **Najdat** | Najdah ibn 'Amir (d. 69H) | Permit taqiyyah | ⚠️⚠️⚠️ |
| **Sufriyyah** | Ziyad ibn al-Asfar | Less extreme than Azariqah | ⚠️⚠️ |
| **Ibadiyyah** | 'Abdullah ibn Ibad (d. ~86H) | Closest to Sunnah | ⚠️ |

### The Azariqah: Most Extreme Khawarij

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Scene: Terror of the Azariqah — Ahwaz, ~65 AH**

*The Azariqah attack a town. A Muslim man flees with his family.*

**Azraqi commander**: "Stop him! Test him!"

**Azraqi** *(to the man)*: "What is your position on Abu Bakr and 'Umar?"

**The man**: "I love them! They are the best people after the Prophet ﷺ!"

**Azraqi**: "And 'Uthman and 'Ali?"

**The man**: "I love them too!"

**Azraqi**: "He loves the apostates! Kill him and his family!"

*They killed the man, his wife, and his children.*

</div>

The Azariqah believed:
- All Muslims outside their group are disbelievers
- Their land is "territory of disbelief"
- It is permissible to kill their women and children
- The child of a "disbeliever" is in Hell

### The Ibadiyyah: The Mildest

| Difference | Ibadiyyah | Other Khawarij |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Ruling on dissenters** | Ungrateful disbelievers, not polytheists | Polytheists |
| **Marriage to them** | Permissible | Prohibited |
| **Their slaughtered animals** | Lawful | Unlawful |
| **Armed rebellion** | Not obligatory | Obligatory |

**Current presence**: Oman, Zanzibar, Libya (Nafusa Mountain), Algeria (Mzab)

## 📖 Part 6: Ibn 'Abbas's Historic Debate

### The Context

When 12,000 men broke away from 'Ali, he decided to send **the most knowledgeable of the Ummah** to bring them back to the truth.

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Scene: Ibn 'Abbas Before the Khawarij — Harura', 37 AH**

*Ibn 'Abbas رضي الله عنهما arrives at the Khawarij camp. He wears his finest clothes.*

**The Khawarij** *(surprised)*: "Welcome, O Ibn 'Abbas! What brings you?"

**Ibn 'Abbas**: "I come to you from the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ — the Muhajirun and Ansar — and from the Prophet's cousin. Upon them the Quran was revealed, and they are more knowledgeable of its interpretation than you."

**The Khawarij**: "Speak, we will listen to you."

**Ibn 'Abbas**: "What do you hold against the Commander of the Faithful?"

</div>

### The Three Accusations and Their Refutation

| Accusation | Ibn 'Abbas's Response |
|------------|----------------------|
| **1. Arbitration by men** | ﴾Let two just persons among you judge﴿ [Al-Ma'idah: 95] — If arbitration is allowed for a rabbit, is it not allowed for the blood of Muslims? |
| **2. No spoils or captives** | Would you take 'Aisha as a captive? She is your mother by the Quran! |
| **3. Erased the title "Commander of the Faithful"** | The Prophet ﷺ erased "Messenger of Allah" at Hudaybiyyah. Did he leave prophethood? |

### The Result

<div class="quote-box">

**Result of the Debate:**

- ✅ **2,000** returned to the truth
- ✅ **4,000** hesitated then returned
- ❌ **6,000** persisted in their error

**The lesson**: Dialogue with evidence can bring back half the misguided!

</div>

## ⚔️ Part 7: The Assassination of 'Ali

### The Conspiracy

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Scene: The Assassins' Pact — Mecca, 40 AH**

*Three Khawarij meet during the Hajj season.*

**'Abd ar-Rahman ibn Muljam**: "What if we killed these three — 'Ali, Mu'awiya, and 'Amr — who have corrupted the affairs of the people?"

**Al-Burak ibn 'Abdullah**: "I will take care of Mu'awiya."

**'Amr ibn Bakr**: "And I will take care of 'Amr ibn al-'As."

**Ibn Muljam**: "And I will take care of 'Ali. Our appointment is the 17th of Ramadan — we strike all at once."

*They dipped their swords in poison.*

</div>

### The Night of 17th Ramadan 40 AH

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Scene: The Martyrdom of 'Ali — Kufa Mosque, Dawn of 17th Ramadan 40 AH**

*'Ali رضي الله عنه comes out for Fajr prayer. Ibn Muljam awaits him.*

**'Ali** *(to the people)*: "The prayer, the prayer!"

*Ibn Muljam strikes 'Ali with his poisoned sword on his head.*

**Ibn Muljam**: "The judgment belongs to Allah, not to you or your companions!"

**'Ali** *(mortally wounded)*: "Do not let the man escape you!"

*He was caught. 'Ali lived three days then passed away. Before his death, he said:*

**'Ali**: "Feed him and give him drink. If I live, I am the guardian of my blood: if I wish, I will pardon, and if I wish, I will take retaliation. And if I die, kill him as he killed me."

</div>

### The Fate of the Three Assassins

| Assassin | Target | Result |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **Ibn Muljam** | 'Ali | ✅ Succeeded — 'Ali died a martyr |
| **Al-Burak** | Mu'awiya | ⚠️ Wounded him but didn't kill him |
| **'Amr ibn Bakr** | 'Amr ibn al-'As | ❌ Killed someone else by mistake |

## ⚖️ Part 8: The Ahl as-Sunnah Ruling

### Are They Disbelievers?

| Position | Proponents | Evidence |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **Innovators, not disbelievers** | Majority of Ahl as-Sunnah | 'Ali fought them but didn't treat them as apostates |
| **Disbelievers** | Some scholars | Their takfir of the Companions |

<div class="quote-box">

**Imam Ahmad said:**

**"The Khawarij are evil people; I know no people more evil than them."**

*But he did not excommunicate them.*

</div>

### How to Deal with Them

| Stage | Actions |
|-------|---------|
| 1️⃣ **Dialogue First** | Send scholars (like Ibn 'Abbas), Refute their doubts, Give them time to return |
| 2️⃣ **If They Persist** | Cut ties, Warn against them, Isolate them |
| 3️⃣ **If They Shed Blood** | Fighting them becomes obligatory, Protection of Muslims, As 'Ali did at Nahrawan |

---

## 🎯 Part 9: Contemporary Case Studies

### Case 1: Easy Takfir

<div class="scene-box">

**📜 Scene: The Young "Scholar" — Local Mosque, Today**

**Young man**: "The one who abandons prayer is a disbeliever! He must be killed!"

**Wise sheikh**: "And who gave you the right to judge and execute?"

**Young man**: "The hadith says the one who abandons prayer is a disbeliever!"

**Sheikh**: "And the conditions? And the preventive factors? And the competent authority? Do you think you know more than the Companions who differed on this issue?"

</div>

**Ruling**:
- ⚠️ Legitimate scholarly disagreement on the ruling of one who abandons prayer
- ❌ Judgment and execution **is not for individuals**
- ✅ This is the role of **the judge** after establishing the proof

---

### Case 2: Armed Rebellion

**Situation**: A group says: "This ruler is corrupt! Let us take up arms!"

| Condition | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Clear disbelief** | Not just oppression or sin, but **explicit disbelief** |
| **Proof from Allah** | Explicit text, not ijtihad |
| **Real capability** | Ability to change without destruction |
| **No greater harm** | Civil war, chaos, more victims |

<div class="quote-box">

**The Prophet ﷺ said:**

**"You hear and obey, even if your back is beaten and your wealth is taken."**

**[Muslim 1847]**

</div>

---

### Case 3: "Quranists"

**Situation**: "I am a Quranist, I reject hadiths!"

| Symptom | Connection to Khawarij |
|---------|------------------------|
| Rejection of Sunnah | Khawarij took the Quran without prophetic understanding |
| Literal interpretation | Same methodological errors |
| Claim of purity | Same spiritual arrogance |

**Ruling**: ❌ This is a revival of the Khawarij methodology. The Quran commands following the Prophet ﷺ.

---

### Case 4: Contemporary Extremist Groups

**Question**: Are today's terrorist groups Khawarij?

| Characteristic | Historical Khawarij | Contemporary Groups |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Takfir of Muslims | ✅ | ✅ |
| Killing Muslims | ✅ | ✅ |
| Armed rebellion | ✅ | ✅ |
| Youth and lack of knowledge | ✅ | ✅ |
| Good speech | ✅ | ✅ |
| Leaving the true enemies of the religion | ✅ | ✅ |

<div class="quote-box">

**The Prophet ﷺ said:**

**"They kill the people of Islam and leave the idol worshippers."**

**[Bukhari 3344]**

</div>

## 💡 Pause for Reflection

### The Difference Between Zeal and Extremism

| Praiseworthy Zeal | Blameworthy Excess |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Based on knowledge | Based on emotion |
| Observes nuances | Black and white only |
| Mercy toward Muslims | Harshness toward Muslims |
| Wisdom in action | Hastiness and violence |
| Following scholars | Claiming to know more |
| Patience under oppression | Immediate revolt |

### Personal Questions

- Do you tend to excommunicate easily?
- Are you harsher on Muslims than on non-Muslims?
- Do you study before you judge?
- Do you consult scholars before you act?
