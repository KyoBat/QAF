## The Emergence of the Khawarij

### Historical Background

The Khawarij appeared during the reign of the rightly-guided caliph 'Ali ibn Abi Talib رضي الله عنه, after the arbitration incident at the Battle of Siffin (37H).

### The Origin of the Name

They were called Khawarij (the rebels/seceders) because they revolted against 'Ali رضي الله عنه after he accepted arbitration, proclaiming:
> "You have made men judge in Allah's religion, there is no judgment except for Allah!"

### Their First Slogan
- **"There is no judgment except for Allah"** — A word of truth intended for falsehood
- 'Ali رضي الله عنه said: "It is a word of truth intended for falsehood. Yes, there is no judgment except for Allah, but these people say: there is no authority except for Allah, while people need a leader."

## The Names of the Khawarij

### Various Designations
| Name | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Khawarij | For their rebellion against 'Ali رضي الله عنه |
| Muhakkimah | For raising the slogan "No judgment except for Allah" |
| Haruriyyah | Named after Harura' where they first gathered |
| Shurat | Because they claimed to have sold their souls to Allah |
| Ahl an-Nahrawan | Named after the Battle of Nahrawan |

## The Foundational Beliefs of the Khawarij

### 1. Excommunicating the Committer of Major Sins

This is their greatest principle:
- Whoever commits a major sin becomes a disbeliever and exits Islam
- They make no distinction between disbelief and disobedience
- They judge him to be eternally in Hellfire

**Refutation:**
> Allah تعالى says: {Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills} [An-Nisa: 48]

### 2. Rebellion Against the Muslim Ruler

- They consider it obligatory to revolt against an unjust ruler
- They don't require capability or public interest
- They shed Muslim blood because of this belief

**Refutation:**
> The Prophet ﷺ said: "Whoever leaves obedience and separates from the group then dies, dies a death of Jahiliyyah." [Reported by Muslim]

### 3. Excommunicating the Companions

- They excommunicated 'Ali, Mu'awiya and those with them رضي الله عنهم
- They excommunicated 'Uthman رضي الله عنه and his killers
- They made the blood of the Companions lawful

### 4. Rejection of Consensus

- They don't accept the consensus of the Ummah as legal proof
- They take texts at face value without deep understanding

## Characteristics of the Khawarij in the Sunnah

### The Prophetic Description

Abu Sa'id al-Khudri رضي الله عنه reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:

> "A people will emerge from the East who will recite the Quran but it will not go beyond their throats. They will pass through the religion as an arrow passes through its prey, never to return to it until the arrow returns to its notch. It was asked: what is their sign? He said: their sign is shaved heads." [Agreed upon]

### Their Characteristics
1. **Enthusiasm without knowledge** — They recite the Quran but it doesn't pass their throats
2. **Literalism in understanding** — They take the apparent meanings of texts
3. **Excess in excommunication** — They excommunicate Muslims
4. **Youth and inexperience** — "Foolish minds, young in age"
5. **Violence and aggression** — Shedding blood based on doubts

## Branches of the Khawarij

### Main Branches
1. **The First Muhakkimah** — The origin of the Khawarij
2. **Azariqah** — Followers of Nafi' ibn al-Azraq (the most extreme)
3. **Najdat** — Followers of Najdah ibn 'Amir
4. **Sufriyyah** — Followers of Ziyad ibn al-Asfar
5. **Ibadiyyah** — Followers of 'Abdullah ibn Ibad (closest to the Sunnah)

## The Position of Ahl as-Sunnah Towards the Khawarij

### The Ruling on Them
- The majority of Ahl as-Sunnah: **they are sinful innovators but not disbelievers**
- Some scholars excommunicated them due to their excommunication of the Companions

### How to Deal with Them
1. Invite them with wisdom and good admonition
2. Establish proof against them
3. Fight them if they shed blood and violate sacred limits

## Lessons Learned

1. **The danger of extremism** — It leads to deviation
2. **The importance of religious knowledge** — Enthusiasm alone is not enough
3. **Caution in excommunication** — We don't excommunicate for every sin
4. **Understanding objectives** — No rigidity on apparent meanings
