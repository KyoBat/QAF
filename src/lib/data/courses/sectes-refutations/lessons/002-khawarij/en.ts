## The Emergence of the Khawarij

### Historical Background

The Khawarij appeared during the reign of the rightly-guided caliph 'Ali ibn Abi Talib رضي الله عنه, after the arbitration incident at the Battle of Siffin (37H).

### The Origin of the Name

They were called Khawarij (the rebels/seceders) because they revolted against 'Ali رضي الله عنه after he accepted arbitration, proclaiming:
> "You have made men judge in Allah's religion, there is no judgment except for Allah!"

### Their First Slogan
- **"There is no judgment except for Allah"** — A word of truth intended for falsehood
- 'Ali رضي الله عنه said: "It is a word of truth intended for falsehood. Yes, there is no judgment except for Allah, but these people say: there is no authority except for Allah, while people need a leader."

## The Names of the Khawarij

### Various Designations
| Name | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Khawarij | For their rebellion against 'Ali رضي الله عنه |
| Muhakkimah | For raising the slogan "No judgment except for Allah" |
| Haruriyyah | Named after Harura' where they first gathered |
| Shurat | Because they claimed to have sold their souls to Allah |
| Ahl an-Nahrawan | Named after the Battle of Nahrawan |

## The Foundational Beliefs of the Khawarij

### 1. Excommunicating the Committer of Major Sins

This is their greatest principle:
- Whoever commits a major sin becomes a disbeliever and exits Islam
- They make no distinction between disbelief and disobedience
- They judge him to be eternally in Hellfire

**Refutation:**
> Allah تعالى says: {Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills} [An-Nisa: 48]

### 2. Rebellion Against the Muslim Ruler

- They consider it obligatory to revolt against an unjust ruler
- They don't require capability or public interest
- They shed Muslim blood because of this belief

**Refutation:**
> The Prophet ﷺ said: "Whoever leaves obedience and separates from the group then dies, dies a death of Jahiliyyah." [Reported by Muslim]

### 3. Excommunicating the Companions

- They excommunicated 'Ali, Mu'awiya and those with them رضي الله عنهم
- They excommunicated 'Uthman رضي الله عنه and his killers
- They made the blood of the Companions lawful

### 4. Rejection of Consensus

- They don't accept the consensus of the Ummah as legal proof
- They take texts at face value without deep understanding

## Characteristics of the Khawarij in the Sunnah

### The Prophetic Description

Abu Sa'id al-Khudri رضي الله عنه reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:

> "A people will emerge from the East who will recite the Quran but it will not go beyond their throats. They will pass through the religion as an arrow passes through its prey, never to return to it until the arrow returns to its notch. It was asked: what is their sign? He said: their sign is shaved heads." [Agreed upon]

### Their Characteristics
1. **Enthusiasm without knowledge** — They recite the Quran but it doesn't pass their throats
2. **Literalism in understanding** — They take the apparent meanings of texts
3. **Excess in excommunication** — They excommunicate Muslims
4. **Youth and inexperience** — "Foolish minds, young in age"
5. **Violence and aggression** — Shedding blood based on doubts

## Branches of the Khawarij

### Main Branches
1. **The First Muhakkimah** — The origin of the Khawarij
2. **Azariqah** — Followers of Nafi' ibn al-Azraq (the most extreme)
3. **Najdat** — Followers of Najdah ibn 'Amir
4. **Sufriyyah** — Followers of Ziyad ibn al-Asfar
5. **Ibadiyyah** — Followers of 'Abdullah ibn Ibad (closest to the Sunnah)

## The Position of Ahl as-Sunnah Towards the Khawarij

### The Ruling on Them
- The majority of Ahl as-Sunnah: **they are sinful innovators but not disbelievers**
- Some scholars excommunicated them due to their excommunication of the Companions

### How to Deal with Them
1. Invite them with wisdom and good admonition
2. Establish proof against them
3. Fight them if they shed blood and violate sacred limits

## Lessons Learned

1. **The danger of extremism** — It leads to deviation
2. **The importance of religious knowledge** — Enthusiasm alone is not enough
3. **Caution in excommunication** — We don't excommunicate for every sin
4. **Understanding objectives** — No rigidity on apparent meanings

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf: Ibn 'Abbas's Debate with the Khawarij

When the Khawarij rebelled against 'Ali رضي الله عنه, he sent **'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas** رضي الله عنهما to debate them.

Ibn 'Abbas asked them: **"What do you have against the Commander of the Faithful?"**

**They said: Three things:**
1. He made men judge in Allah's religion
2. He did not take the women of those who fought as captives nor their wealth as spoils
3. He erased the title "Commander of the Faithful" from himself in the peace treaty

**Ibn 'Abbas answered:**

**On the first**: Allah تعالى says regarding hunting: {Let two just persons among you judge} So if arbitration is allowed for a rabbit, how not for the blood of Muslims?

**On the second**: Would you take 'Aisha, the Mother of the Believers, as a captive? She is your mother by the text of the Quran!

**On the third**: The Prophet ﷺ himself erased "Messenger of Allah" in the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah. Did he leave prophethood?

**Two thousand of them returned!** The rest persisted in their falsehood.

**Lesson learned**: Dialogue with evidence and proof is more effective than the sword.

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases: Do You Know Today's Khawarij?

### Case 1: Excommunication for Sin
**A young man** says: "Whoever doesn't pray is a disbeliever apostate who must be killed immediately!"

**Question**: Is this the methodology of Ahl as-Sunnah?

**Answer**:
- ⚠️ The one who abandons prayer is a matter of scholarly disagreement
- ❌ **However** judging a specific individual and executing the punishment is not for ordinary people
- ✅ This is the jurisdiction of the Islamic judiciary after calling for repentance

---

### Case 2: Rebellion Against the Ruler
**A group** says: "This ruler is unjust, we must rebel against him with weapons!"

**Question**: What is the position of Ahl as-Sunnah?

**Answer**:
- ❌ **Armed rebellion**: Prohibited according to the majority of Ahl as-Sunnah except with three conditions:
  1. Clear disbelief for which we have proof from Allah
  2. Capability to change
  3. That it doesn't lead to greater harm

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"You hear and obey, even if your back is beaten and your wealth is taken"**

---

### Case 3: "I Only Follow the Quran!"
**A person** says: "I am Quran-only, I don't believe in the Sunnah!"

**Question**: Is this an extension of Khawarij thought?

**Answer**:
- ✅ The Khawarij began by rejecting the Sunnah and understanding the Quran literally
- ✅ This thinking leads to the same results: extremism or negligence
- Allah تعالى says: {And whatever the Messenger gives you, take it; and whatever he forbids you, abstain from it}

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

**Personal question**:

What is the difference between:
- **Praiseworthy zeal** for the religion
- **Blameworthy extremism** and excess?

**Reflect:**
- The Companions were the most zealous for the religion
- Yet they did not excommunicate Muslims nor make their blood lawful
- **The difference**: Knowledge, mercy, and wisdom

> The Prophet ﷺ said about the Khawarij: **"They kill the people of Islam and leave the idol worshippers"**

Have you seen today someone who is harsh with his Muslim brothers yet lenient with the enemies of the religion?
