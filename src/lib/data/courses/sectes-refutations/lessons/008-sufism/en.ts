### 3. Excess Regarding Saints
- Calling upon saints and seeking their help
- Circumambulating graves and seeking their blessing
- Believing saints control the universe

## The Position of Ahl as-Sunnah

### Distinction and Detail

| Type | Ruling |
|------|--------|
| Legal asceticism | Legitimate and praiseworthy |
| Sunni Sufism | Praiseworthy if bound by the Law |
| Excess and deviation | Innovation and misguidance |
| Unity of Existence | Disbelief and apostasy |

### Rules of Judgment
1. **The scale is the Divine Law** not tastes and ecstasies
2. **Every act without legal basis** is rejected
3. **True sainthood** is conformity to the Quran and Sunnah

### What Ibn Taymiyyah Said
> "The Sufis who are people of uprightness upon the Quran and Sunnah are among the best servants of Allah. As for those who deviated from them, they are misguided and deviant."

## Conclusion

Sufism is a varied phenomenon:
- **Part of it conforms to the Law** — like the asceticism of the Salaf
- **Part of it is innovation** — like invented dhikr and orders
- **Part of it is disbelief** — like Unity of Existence and incarnation
