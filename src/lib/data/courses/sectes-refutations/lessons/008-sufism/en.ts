## Introduction

Sufism is a complex phenomenon oscillating between the legitimate asceticism practiced by the Salaf and the grave excesses that contradict the Quran and the Sunnah. This lesson distinguishes the good from the blameworthy.

# Part 1: Origins and Definitions

## 📜 What is Sufism?

### The Disputed Etymology

| Proposed Origin | Meaning | Relevance |
|-----------------|---------|-----------|
| **As-Suf** (الصُّوف) | Their wearing of wool garments out of austerity | ✅ The most probable opinion |
| **As-Safa** (الصَّفاء) | The purity of their hearts | Linguistically weak |
| **Ahl as-Suffah** | The people of the Suffah among the Companions | ⚠️ Unlikely — the Companions were not "Sufis" |
| **Sophia** (Greek) | Wisdom | ❌ Improbable |

### Technical Definition

<div class="quote-box">

**Neutral definition**:
> A spiritual path based on educating the soul (tarbiyat an-nafs), purifying it through intensive worship and dhikr, to reach high "ranks" of closeness to Allah.

**The problem**: This definition hides great diversity — from the legitimate to the disbelieving.

## ⏳ The Four Phases of Sufism

### Phase 1: The Asceticism of the Salaf (1st-2nd century H)

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 Scene 1: Al-Hasan al-Basri — True Asceticism**

**Basra — Early 2nd century H**

*Al-Hasan al-Basri walks through the streets of Basra, his head lowered, absorbed in reflection.*

**A disciple**: O Abu Sa'id, why are you always so sad?

**Al-Hasan** *(eyes moist)*: How can I not be sad when I don't know if Allah has accepted a single one of my deeds? How can I not weep when I don't know what He has decreed for me?

**The disciple**: But you are the Imam of Basra!

**Al-Hasan**: The Imam of Basra will die like everyone else. What matters is what comes after.

*He returns home, a modest house. His food: bread and salt. His nights: spent in prayer and weeping.*

</div>

**What characterized these early ascetics**:
- ✅ Asceticism conforming to the Quran and Sunnah
- ✅ No special terminology or separate paths
- ✅ No distinction from "ordinary Muslims"
- ✅ No "Sufism" as a distinct movement

---

### Phase 2: Appearance of the Term (2nd-3rd century H)

The word "Sufi" (صُوفي) appeared for the first time in the 2nd century:
- Beginning of distinction from the "common people"
- Emergence of specific terminology
- First signs of separatism

---

### Phase 3: Codification and Organization (3rd-4th century H)

- 📚 Appearance of foundational books: *Al-Luma'*, *Ar-Risalah al-Qushayriyyah*
- 🏛️ Birth of Sufi orders (turuq)
- ⚠️ Beginning of mixing with Greek philosophy and foreign influences

---

### Phase 4: Excess and Deviation (from the 5th century H)

The appearance of the most dangerous doctrines:
- 🔴 **Wahdat al-Wujud** — Unity of Existence
- 🔴 **Al-Hulul** — Incarnation
- 🔴 **Al-Ittihad** — Union with God
- 🔴 Excessive sanctification of saints

| **Sheikh** (Murshid) | The spiritual guide | ⚠️ Sometimes excessive obedience |
| **Murid** (Disciple) | The spiritual traveler | ⚠️ Sometimes blind submission |
| **Bay'ah** (Allegiance) | Covenant with the sheikh | ⚠️ Has no legal basis |
| **Tariqa** (Path) | The Sufi order | ⚠️ Divides the Ummah |

<div class="quote-box">

**Their problematic rule**:
> "The disciple in the hands of his sheikh is like the deceased in the hands of the washer."

**The response**: There is no obedience to a creature in disobedience to the Creator!

# Part 3: Notable Figures

## 🌟 The Authentic Ascetics

### Al-Fudayl ibn 'Iyad (d. 187 H)

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 Scene 2: From Bandit to Saint — The Conversion of al-Fudayl**

**Somewhere between Khorasan and Mecca — 2nd century H**

*Al-Fudayl was a highway robber, plundering caravans with his gang.*

*One night, while climbing a wall to reach a woman, he heard a voice reciting:*

**The voice** *(reciting Quran)*: ﴾Is it not time for those who have believed that their hearts should become humbly submissive at the remembrance of Allah?﴿ [Al-Hadid: 16]

**Al-Fudayl** *(stopping abruptly, trembling)*: Yes, Lord! It is time! It is time!

*He descended from the wall and spent the night in an abandoned ruin, weeping and imploring Allah's forgiveness.*

*The next day, he overheard a conversation:*

**Traveler 1**: We must wait, al-Fudayl the brigand is on this road.

**Traveler 2**: Yes, he lets no one pass.

**Al-Fudayl** *(emerging from his hiding place, eyes full of tears)*: Al-Fudayl has repented! Pass in peace!

*He went to Mecca and became one of the greatest ascetics of Islam.*

</div>

**His famous sayings**:
> "If I knew that Allah had accepted a single prostration from me, it would be dearer to me than the world and all it contains."

> "Whoever seeks a brother without faults will remain without a brother."

## ⚫ Controversial Figures

### Al-Hallaj (d. 309 H)

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 Scene 3: "I am the Truth!" — The Fatal Words of al-Hallaj**

**Baghdad — 309 H**

*Husayn ibn Mansur al-Hallaj is brought before the judge. Around him, a crowd of onlookers.*

**The judge**: You said: "Ana al-Haqq" — "I am the Truth." Al-Haqq is one of the Names of Allah. Did you claim to be God?

**Al-Hallaj** *(in a state of ecstasy)*: I am the Truth... In my robe there is only God...

**The judge**: Answer clearly!

**The scholars present**: This is explicit disbelief!

*Al-Hallaj was condemned to death and executed.*

</div>

<div class="quote-box">

**The analysis of Ahl as-Sunnah**:

| Interpretation | Judgment |
|----------------|----------|
| If he meant that he IS Allah | **Explicit disbelief** |
| If he meant the extinction of his ego in contemplation | **Blameworthy excess** — heretical expression |

**The rule**: "Ecstatic utterances" (shatahat) are not excused if they clearly contradict Tawhid.

</div>

### Ibn 'Arabi (d. 638 H) — The Theoretician of Wahdat al-Wujud

<div class="quote-box">

**What he wrote in his books**:

> "The servant is Lord and the Lord is servant — oh, if only I knew who was the obligated one!"

> "He who worships the sun sees only the sun, and he who worships fire sees only fire... But all in reality worship the same thing."

**The judgment of the scholars**:
- **Ibn Taymiyyah**: "His words are more disbelieving than those of the Jews and Christians."
- **Adh-Dhahabi**: "If his words are not disbelief, then there is no disbelief in the world."

</div>

---

# Part 4: The Major Deviations

## 🔴 1. Wahdat al-Wujud — Unity of Existence

**Meaning**: There exists only one reality. The Creator and creation are ONE. Everything that exists is God.

**Logical consequences of this belief**:
- ❌ Pharaoh worshiped Allah (since everything is Allah)
- ❌ Idols are Allah
- ❌ Good and evil are identical
- ❌ No difference between Paradise and Hellfire

**Ruling**: **Explicit disbelief** (kufr sarih)

---

## 🔴 2. Al-Hulul and Al-Ittihad

| Doctrine | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Al-Hulul** (الحلول) | Allah incarnates in certain creatures | "God entered into me" |
| **Al-Ittihad** (الاتحاد) | Total union between the servant and God | "I have become Him" |

**Ruling**: **Disbelief** — because it negates the fundamental distinction between the Creator and creation.

---

## 🔴 3. Excess Concerning Saints

<div class="scene-box">

**🎭 Scene 4: A Common Scene in Some Muslim Countries**

**Near the tomb of a "wali" — In our times**

*A crowd gathers around a decorated mausoleum.*

**Woman 1** *(touching the grille of the tomb)*: O Sidi [Master], I need a child, give me a child!

**Man** *(lighting candles)*: O Mawlana [Our Master], heal my sick son!

**Guardian of the mausoleum**: Go around seven times, like around the Ka'bah...

</div>

**What is practiced**:
- 🔴 Invoking dead saints
- 🔴 Asking them for what only Allah can provide
- 🔴 Circumambulating graves
- 🔴 Believing that saints "control the universe"

**Ruling**: **Major shirk** when asking them for what only Allah can do.

---

## 🔴 4. Practical Innovations

| Innovation | Description | Ruling |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Collective dhikr with dancing** | Rhythmic movements, sometimes in circles | Bid'ah |
| **Mawlid** | Celebration of the Prophet's ﷺ birthday | Bid'ah |
| **Hadra** | Sessions of trance and ecstasy | Grave bid'ah |
| **Invented awrad** | Unreported formulas, fixed numbers | Bid'ah |
| **Sama'** | "Spiritual" music and songs | Bid'ah |

---

# Part 5: The Balanced Position

## ⚖️ The Balance of Ahl as-Sunnah

<div class="quote-box">

**Ibn Taymiyyah said**:
> "The Sufis who are people of uprightness upon the Quran and Sunnah are among the best servants of Allah. As for those who deviated from them, they are misguided and deviant."

</div>

### Judgment Table

| Type | Examples | Ruling |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Legal asceticism** | Al-Hasan al-Basri, al-Fudayl | ✅ Praiseworthy |
| **Sunni Sufism** | Adherence to the Law with tarbiyah | ⚠️ Acceptable if conforming |
| **Minor innovations** | Some specific adhkar | ❌ Minor bid'ah |
| **Grave innovations** | Hadra, dancing, excess toward saints | ❌ Grave bid'ah |
| **Wahdat al-Wujud / Hulul** | Ibn 'Arabi, al-Hallaj | 🔴 Disbelief |

---

## 🎯 Contemporary Case Studies

### Case 1: Collective Dhikr with Drums

**Question**: In some countries, people gather for dhikr with rhythms and dancing movements. What is the ruling?

**Answer**:
- ❌ **Reprehensible innovation** — The Prophet ﷺ and the Companions never did this
- ❌ Dhikr is a prescribed act of worship (tawqifiyyah)
- ✅ **Legitimate dhikr**: With the heart and tongue, in humility and tranquility

---

### Case 2: "O Sidi, Help Me!"

**Question**: A man goes to the grave of a saint and says: "O my master, help me!" What is the ruling?

**Answer**:
- 🔴 **Major shirk** — Seeking help from other than Allah in what only Allah can do
- Allah تعالى says: ﴾And those you invoke besides Him do not possess even a qitmir (date-seed's membrane)﴿ [Fatir: 13]

---

### Case 3: The Sheikh's Litanies

**Question**: The sheikh of the order requires: "Say this dhikr 1000 times after Fajr." What is the ruling?

**Answer**:
- ⚠️ Specifying a number or time not reported = **innovation**
- ✅ What is legitimate: The adhkar reported in the Sunnah
- 💡 No obedience to the sheikh in what contradicts the Law

---

### Case 4: "The Sheikh Knows the Unseen!"

**Question**: A disciple says: "Our sheikh knows what is in our hearts!"

**Answer**:
- 🔴 **A belief of disbelief** — Knowledge of the unseen belongs to Allah alone
- Allah تعالى says: ﴾Say: None in the heavens and earth knows the unseen except Allah﴿ [An-Naml: 65]

---

## 💡 How to Distinguish the True Saint?

<div class="quote-box">

**Ibn Taymiyyah's golden criterion**:
> "Whoever claims sainthood for himself or for another while contradicting the Sharia of Islam is a liar."

**Signs of the true wali**:
1. ✅ Uprightness upon the Quran and Sunnah
2. ✅ Does not call to himself
3. ✅ Does not claim to know the unseen
4. ✅ Does not claim to control the universe
5. ✅ Does not consume people's wealth unjustly

</div>

---

## ✅ Conclusion

Sufism is a **varied** phenomenon that cannot be judged as a whole:

| Category | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| Asceticism conforming to the Law | ✅ Praiseworthy |
| Orders and innovations | ❌ Bid'ah |
| Wahdat al-Wujud and Hulul | 🔴 Disbelief |

**Our position**: We take the good and reject the bad, with knowledge and justice.
