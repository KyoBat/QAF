## The Emergence of Sufism

- The asceticism of the righteous predecessors like Uways al-Qarni and al-Hasan al-Basri
- Was not called Sufism
- Balanced asceticism without excess

### Second Phase: Appearance of the term "Sufism" (2nd-3rd century)
- The term "Sufi" appeared in the second century
- Beginning of distinction from ordinary Muslims
- Emergence of specific terminology

### Third Phase: Codification and Organization (3rd-4th century)
- Appearance of Sufi books: Al-Luma', Ar-Risalah al-Qushayriyyah
- Emergence of Sufi orders (turuq)
- Beginning of mixing with philosophy

### Fourth Phase: Excess and Deviation (from the 5th century)
- Unity of Existence (wahdat al-wujud)
- Incarnation and union (hulul and ittihad)
- Sanctification of saints

## Sufi Concepts

### 1. Stations and States
- **Stations (Maqamat)**: Abodes acquired by the traveler through effort (repentance, asceticism, patience...)
- **States (Ahwal)**: Divine gifts not acquired (contraction, expansion, extinction...)

### 2. The Path and the Reality
- **The Path (Tariqah)**: The practical conduct to reach Allah
- **The Reality (Haqiqah)**: The esoteric knowledge according to them

### 3. The Sheikh and the Disciple
- **The Sheikh**: The educator who guides the disciple
- **The Murid**: The traveling disciple
- **The Path Allegiance**: A covenant taken by the disciple from the sheikh

- **Author**: Muhyi ad-Din ibn 'Arabi
- **Ruling**: Explicit disbelief

### 2. Incarnation and Union
- **Incarnation (Hulul)**: Allah incarnates in some of His creation

- Al-Hallaj's statement: "I am the Truth" (Ana al-Haqq)

### 3. Excess Regarding Saints
- Calling upon saints and seeking their help
- Circumambulating graves and seeking their blessing
- Believing saints control the universe

### 4. Practical Innovations
- Collective dhikr with dancing and rhythm
- Birthday celebrations (Mawlid) and hadra gatherings
- Innovated litanies (awrad) and formulas (ahzab)

## The Position of Ahl as-Sunnah

### Distinction and Detail

| Type | Ruling |
|------|--------|
| Legal asceticism | Legitimate and praiseworthy |
| Sunni Sufism | Praiseworthy if bound by the Law |
| Excess and deviation | Innovation and misguidance |
| Unity of Existence | Disbelief and apostasy |

### Rules of Judgment
1. **The scale is the Divine Law** not tastes and ecstasies
2. **Every act without legal basis** is rejected
3. **True sainthood** is conformity to the Quran and Sunnah

### What Ibn Taymiyyah Said
> "The Sufis who are people of uprightness upon the Quran and Sunnah are among the best servants of Allah. As for those who deviated from them, they are misguided and deviant."

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf: Al-Fudayl ibn 'Iyad

**Al-Fudayl ibn 'Iyad** was a highway robber, then he repented and became one of the great ascetics.

He used to say: **"If the people of the heavens and earth gathered to demean me, they could not. And if they gathered to raise me, they could not—if Allah is with me."**

He used to say: **"If Allah loves a servant, He tests him. If he is patient, He selects him. If he is content, He chooses him."**

**Lesson learned**: This is true asceticism—no dancing, no drums.

---

## 📖 From History: The Statement of al-Hallaj

Al-Hallaj said: **"Ana al-Haqq!" (I am the Truth!)**

He was sentenced to death.

**Analysis of Ahl as-Sunnah:**
- If he meant that he is Allah = explicit disbelief
- If he meant the annihilation of his self in witnessing the Truth = blameworthy excess in expression

**The lesson**: Sufi ecstatic utterances (shatahat) are not accepted, and ambiguous statements are not interpreted in favor of their speaker if their apparent meaning is disbelief.

---

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases: What is the Ruling?

### Case 1: Collective Dhikr with Drums and Dancing

**In some countries** people gather for dhikr with rhythm and dancing movements.

**Question**: What is the ruling?

**Answer**:
- ❌ **Reprehensible innovation** — The Prophet ﷺ and the Companions never did this
- ❌ Dhikr is an act of worship that must be done according to prescription
- ✅ **Prescribed dhikr**: With the heart and tongue, in humility and tranquility

---

### Case 2: Seeking Help from a Saint at His Grave

**A man** goes to the grave of a righteous saint and says: "O my master, help me!"

**Question**: What is the ruling?

**Answer**:
- 🔴 **Major shirk** — Seeking help from other than Allah in what only Allah can do
- Allah تعالى says: {And those you invoke besides Him do not possess even a qitmir (date-seed's membrane)}

---

### Case 3: The Order's Litanies

**The sheikh of the order** obligates his disciples with specific litanies: "Say this dhikr 1000 times after Fajr"

**Question**: What is the ruling?

**Answer**:
- ⚠️ Specifying a number or time not mentioned = **innovation**
- ✅ What is prescribed: The adhkar mentioned in the Sunnah
- 💡 There is no obedience to the sheikh in disobedience to Allah

---

### Case 4: "The Sheikh Knows the Unseen!"

**A disciple** says: "Our sheikh knows what is in our hearts!"

**Question**: What is the ruling?

**Answer**:
- 🔴 **A belief of disbelief** — Knowledge of the unseen belongs to Allah alone
- Allah تعالى says: {Say, none in the heavens and earth knows the unseen except Allah}

---

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

**Personal question**:

How do you distinguish between:
- **The true saint**
- **The lying claimant**?

**The golden criterion:**

> Ibn Taymiyyah said: **"Anyone who claims sainthood for himself or another while contradicting the Sharia of Islam is a liar."**

**Signs of the true saint:**
1. Uprightness upon the Quran and Sunnah
2. Does not call to himself
3. Does not claim knowledge of the unseen or control over the universe
4. Does not consume people's wealth unlawfully

---

## Conclusion

Sufism is a varied phenomenon:
- **Part of it conforms to the Law** — like the asceticism of the Salaf
- **Part of it is innovation** — like invented dhikr and orders
- **Part of it is disbelief** — like Unity of Existence and incarnation
