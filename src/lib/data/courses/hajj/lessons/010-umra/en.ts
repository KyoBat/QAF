export const content = `# Al-'Umra: The Lesser Pilgrimage (العُمْرَة)

## Introduction

'Umra is the "lesser pilgrimage" that can be performed at any time of the year, unlike Hajj which has specific dates. It constitutes a visit to Allah's Sacred House, an act of worship that purifies the soul and brings the servant closer to his Lord. Though less complex than Hajj, 'Umra possesses immense spiritual value and represents for many Muslims their first contact with the holy sites.

## 📜 Foundational Texts (النصوص الأساسية)

### The Quran

> **"And complete the Hajj and 'Umra for Allah. But if you are prevented, then [offer] what can be obtained with ease of sacrificial animals."**
> — [Al-Baqara: 196]

> **"Indeed, as-Safa and al-Marwah are among the symbols of Allah. So whoever makes Hajj to the House or performs 'Umra - there is no blame upon him for walking between them."**
> — [Al-Baqara: 158]

### The Sunnah

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"'Umra to 'Umra expiates what is between them, and the accepted Hajj has no reward except Paradise."**
> — [Al-Bukhari (1773), Muslim (1349)]

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"'Umra in Ramadan equals a Hajj"** — and in another narration: **"a Hajj with me."**
> — [Al-Bukhari (1863), Muslim (1256)]

## 🎓 Scholarly Opinions (أقوال العلماء)

> **Imam Malik (رحمه الله)** said:
> "'Umra is a Sunnah, and I do not know anyone among the people of knowledge who made it obligatory. However, I do not like that anyone should leave it."
> — [Al-Mudawwana, 1/367]

> **Imam Ibn Rushd (رحمه الله)** explained:
> "The scholars have differed on the obligation of 'Umra. Malik and Abu Hanifa say it is Sunnah. Ash-Shafi'i and Ahmad say it is obligatory once in a lifetime, like Hajj. The difference stems from the interpretation of the verse 'Complete the Hajj and 'Umra for Allah.'"
> — [Bidayat al-Mujtahid, 2/96]

> **Imam an-Nawawi (رحمه الله)** said:
> "'Umra is obligatory once in a lifetime according to our school. Its evidence is the verse 'Complete the Hajj and 'Umra for Allah,' which commands both together."
> — [Al-Majmu', 7/6]

> **Ibn al-Qayyim (رحمه الله)** wrote:
> "The Prophet ﷺ performed four 'Umras, all in the month of Dhul-Qi'da, except the one with the Farewell Hajj. He never performed 'Umra from Makkah going out to Tan'im, as that was not his practice."
> — [Zad al-Ma'ad, 2/89]
