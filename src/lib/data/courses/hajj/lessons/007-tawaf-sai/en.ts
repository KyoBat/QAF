> Tawaf (circumambulation) around the Ka'ba and Sa'i (walking) between Safa and Marwa are among the most emblematic rites of pilgrimage. **Tawaf al-Ifada is a pillar of Hajj, while Sa'i is also a pillar according to the majority of scholars.** These two rites connect the pilgrim to prophetic history: Tawaf recalls the devotion of prophets since Ibrahim عليه السلام, and Sa'i commemorates Hajar's عليها السلام search for water for her son Isma'il.

## 📜 Reference Hadith

> عَنْ جَابِرٍ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ في وَصْفِ حَجَّةِ النَّبِيِّ ﷺ قَالَ: **« حَتَّى إِذَا أَتَيْنَا الْبَيْتَ مَعَهُ اسْتَلَمَ الرُّكْنَ فَرَمَلَ ثَلاَثًا وَمَشَى أَرْبَعًا، ثُمَّ نَفَذَ إِلَى مَقَامِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ فَقَرَأَ: ﴿ وَاتَّخِذُوا مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ مُصَلًّى ﴾ فَصَلَّى رَكْعَتَيْنِ »**

From Jabir رضي الله عنه describing the Prophet's ﷺ Hajj: **"When we arrived at the House with him, he touched the Corner (Black Stone), then performed Raml (brisk walking) for three circuits and walked normally for four. Then he proceeded to the Maqam of Ibrahim and recited: 'And take the Maqam of Ibrahim as a place of prayer' — then he prayed two rak'at."**

— [Muslim (1218)]

## 🎓 Scholarly Statements

| Scholar | Source | Quote |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Imam Malik** رحمه الله | *Al-Muwatta'* | "Tawaf al-Ifada is the obligatory Tawaf (of Hajj), it is the Tawaf of the rite (tawaf az-ziyara), and without it Hajj is not complete." |
| **Ibn Rushd** رحمه الله | *Bidayat al-Mujtahid* | "Scholars are unanimous on the obligation of Tawaf al-Ifada. They differ on Sa'i: the majority considers it a pillar, the Hanafis consider it obligatory (wajib) but not a pillar." |
| **Al-Qurtubi** رحمه الله | *Tafsir* | "The expression 'no blame' was revealed because some Companions hesitated to perform Sa'i, thinking it was a practice of Jahiliyya. The verse confirms its obligation." |
| **Khalil ibn Ishaq** رحمه الله | *Al-Mukhtasar* | "The pillars of Hajj are four: Ihram, Wuquf, Tawaf al-Ifada, and Sa'i." |

> 7 laps: Safa → Marwa (1), Marwa → Safa (2), etc., until ending at Marwa (7).

**Q3: What if I lose count of circuits?**
