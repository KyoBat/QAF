## Introduction

The sacrifice (Hady) and stoning (Ramy) are among the most important rites of Hajj, performed primarily on the day of Eid al-Adha (10th Dhul-Hijja) at Mina. The sacrifice commemorates the trial of Ibrahim عليه السلام with his son Isma'il, while stoning symbolizes the rejection of Satan. These rites are both acts of worship and profound symbols of faith and submission to Allah.

## 1. 📜 Foundational Texts (النصوص الأساسية)

### The Quran

> **"Whoever takes advantage of the 'Umra until Hajj, then whatever sacrifice is easily obtainable. And whoever cannot find one - then a fast of three days during Hajj and of seven when you have returned. Those are ten complete days."**
> — [Al-Baqara: 196]

> **"And proclaim to the people the Hajj... that they may witness benefits for themselves and mention the name of Allah on known days over what He has provided for them of [sacrificial] animals."**
> — [Al-Hajj: 27-28]

> **"And remember Allah during the numbered days."**
> — [Al-Baqara: 203]

### The Sunnah

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"The days of Tashriq are days of eating, drinking and remembering Allah."**
> — [Muslim (1141)]

> The Prophet ﷺ said regarding sacrificial animals: **"Four are not acceptable for sacrifice: the one-eyed animal with an obvious defect, the sick animal whose illness is obvious, the lame animal whose lameness is obvious, and the emaciated animal with no marrow."**
> — [At-Tirmidhi (1497), An-Nasa'i (4371)]

## 2. 🗣️ Scholarly Opinions (أقوال العلماء)

> **Imam Malik (رحمه الله)** said:
> "The sacrifice of the Mutamatti' (one performing Hajj Tamattu') and the Qarin (one combining Hajj and 'Umra) is obligatory. If he cannot find something to sacrifice, he fasts three days during Hajj, the best being the last one on the day of Arafat, and seven days when he returns home."
> — [Al-Mudawwana, 1/409]

> **Imam Ibn Rushd (رحمه الله)** explained:
> "The scholars are unanimous on the obligation of sacrifice for the Mutamatti' and Qarin. They differ on the question: is it gratitude for the ease of combining two acts of worship, or compensation for abandoning Hajj Ifrad which was the practice of the people of Makkah?"
> — [Bidayat al-Mujtahid, 2/183]

> **Imam al-Qurtubi (رحمه الله)** said:
> "The stoning of the pillars is a purely ritual act of worship (ta'abbudi). Its meaning is not to stone Satan himself, as he is not there, but to commemorate the act of Ibrahim عليه السلام and manifest obedience to Allah."
> — [Al-Jami' li Ahkam al-Quran, 3/1]

> **Ibn al-Qayyim (رحمه الله)** wrote:
> "Know that the purpose of sacrifice is neither the meat nor the blood, but the piety that accompanies it. Allah says: 'Their meat will not reach Allah, nor will their blood, but what reaches Him is piety from you.'"
> — [Zad al-Ma'ad, 2/315]
