### 📐 Analysis of the Verse

| Segment | Analysis |
|---------|----------|
| **مَنِ اسْتَطَاعَ** | Relative pronoun + past tense verb = condition |
| **إِلَيْهِ** | Preposition + pronoun = toward it (the pilgrimage) |
| **سَبِيلًا** | Object = a way/means |

### 💡 Rhetorical Point (Balaghah)

The word **سَبِيلًا** (a way) is indefinite (نكرة), giving it **general scope**. This allows scholars to interpret "capability" **broadly**: financial, physical, security-related, etc.

## 📚 Detailed Explanation (الشرح المفصل)

### 1️⃣ The Five Conditions of Obligation

#### 📌 Condition 1: Islam (الإسلام)

Hajj is not obligatory upon a non-Muslim, and if performed, it is not valid.

| Situation | Ruling |
|-----------|--------|
| **Non-Muslim** | No obligation |
| **Convert after Hajj** | Must redo Hajj |
| **New convert** | Obligatory upon capability |

#### 📌 Condition 2: Puberty (البلوغ)

A child who has not reached puberty is not obligated. If they perform Hajj, it counts as voluntary.

> **Hadith:** A woman lifted up a child and said: "Does this child have Hajj?" The Prophet ﷺ said: **« نَعَمْ، وَلَكِ أَجْرٌ »** — *"Yes, and you will have a reward."*
> — [Muslim (1336)]

| Situation | Ruling |
|-----------|--------|
| **Hajj before puberty** | Valid as Nafl |
| **After puberty** | Must redo the obligatory Hajj |
| **Reaches puberty during Hajj** | Counts as Fard (according to some) |

#### 📌 Condition 3: Sanity (العقل)

The insane person (المجنون) is not legally responsible and Hajj is not obligatory upon them.

> **Hadith:** **« رُفِعَ الْقَلَمُ عَنْ ثَلاَثَةٍ: عَنِ النَّائِمِ حَتَّى يَسْتَيْقِظَ، وَعَنِ الصَّبِيِّ حَتَّى يَحْتَلِمَ، وَعَنِ الْمَجْنُونِ حَتَّى يَعْقِلَ »**
> *"The pen is lifted from three: the sleeper until he wakes, the child until puberty, and the insane until he regains sanity."*
> — [Abu Dawud (4403)]

#### 📌 Condition 4: Freedom (الحرية)

The slave is not obligated to perform Hajj as they do not own themselves or their wealth.

> **Historical note:** This condition was relevant during the era of slavery. Today it is mentioned for jurisprudential completeness.

#### 📌 Condition 5: Capability (الاستطاعة)

This is the **main** and most **detailed** condition. It includes three aspects:

---

### 2️⃣ The Three Aspects of Istita'a

#### 🔷 A. Physical Capability (الاستطاعة البدنية)

The pilgrim must be physically able to:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Travel** | Ability to bear the journey |
| **Walk** | For essential rites (Tawaf, Sa'i, Arafat) |
| **Stand** | For long stations |

**Case of permanent incapacity:**

| Situation | Ruling 🟡 Maliki |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Old age** | Must delegate someone |
| **Incurable illness** | Must delegate someone |
| **Paralysis** | Must delegate someone |
| **Temporary illness** | Waits for recovery |

> **Hadith of the Khath'amiyyah:** A woman said: "My father is very old and cannot sit on the mount. May I perform Hajj on his behalf?" The Prophet ﷺ said: **« نَعَمْ »** — *"Yes."*
> — [Al-Bukhari (1513), Muslim (1334)]

#### 🔷 B. Financial Capability (الاستطاعة المالية)

| Element | Required |
|---------|----------|
| **Round-trip transport** | ✅ Yes |
| **Accommodation** | ✅ Yes |
| **Food** | ✅ Yes |
| **Family provisions** | ✅ Leave enough for them |
| **Due debts** | ✅ Pay or get creditor's permission |
| **Deferred debts** | ⚠️ Not an obstacle (Maliki) |

#### 🔷 C. Safety of the Route (أَمْنُ الطَّرِيق)

| Danger | Ruling |
|--------|--------|
| **War** | Hajj postponed |
| **Bandits** | Hajj postponed |
| **Severe epidemic** | Hajj postponed |
| **Closed borders** | Hajj postponed |

## 🕌 Opinions of the Madhahib (آراء المذاهب)

### ⚠️ Difference on Mahram for Women

This is one of the major disagreements in Hajj jurisprudence:

| School | Opinion | Evidence |
|--------|---------|----------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | **Not required if safe** | Mahram is for protection; group of trustworthy women suffices |
| 🟢 **Hanafi** | Required | Explicit hadith |
| 🔵 **Shafi'i** | Not required (with conditions) | Trustworthy women suffice |
| 🟣 **Hanbali** | Required | Same as Hanafi |

> 💡 **Detailed Maliki Position:**
> 
> Imam Malik رحمه الله considers that the **objective** (المقصد) of the Mahram is to ensure the **protection and honor** of the woman.
> 
> If she travels:
> - With a **group of trustworthy women** (رُفْقَة مَأْمُونَة)
> - On a **safe route**
> - With **sufficient means**
> 
> Then Hajj is **obligatory** upon her even without a Mahram.

**The reference hadith:**

> **« لاَ تُسَافِرِ الْمَرْأَةُ إِلاَّ مَعَ ذِي مَحْرَمٍ »**
> *"A woman should not travel except with a Mahram."*
> — [Al-Bukhari (1862), Muslim (1341)]

**Maliki interpretation:** This hadith concerns ordinary travel for protection. For Hajj (a divine obligation), safety can be ensured through other means.

### ⚠️ Difference on Going into Debt for Hajj

| School | Opinion |
|--------|---------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | **Not recommended** — Istita'a excludes debt |
| 🟢 **Hanafi** | Not obligatory to incur debt |
| 🔵 **Shafi'i** | Not obligatory to incur debt |
| 🟣 **Hanbali** | Not obligatory to incur debt |

> 💡 **Consensus:** No school requires going into debt for Hajj. One who lacks the means is **not subject** to the obligation.

## 📖 Complementary Evidences (الشواهد)

### From the Sunnah (من السنة)

**1. The pen is lifted:**

> **« رُفِعَ الْقَلَمُ عَنْ ثَلاَثَةٍ... »**
> — [Abu Dawud (4403), At-Tirmidhi (1423)]

**2. Hajj on behalf of others:**

> A man said: "My father is very old. May I perform Hajj for him?" The Prophet ﷺ said: **« حُجَّ عَنْ أَبِيكَ »** — *"Perform Hajj for your father."*
> — [Abu Dawud (1810), An-Nasai (2634)]

**3. Analogy with debt:**

> A woman said: "My mother made a vow to perform Hajj but died. May I do it for her?" The Prophet ﷺ said: **« أَرَأَيْتِ لَوْ كَانَ عَلَى أُمِّكِ دَيْنٌ أَكُنْتِ قَاضِيَتَهُ؟ اقْضُوا اللَّهَ، فَاللَّهُ أَحَقُّ بِالْوَفَاءِ »**
> *"If your mother had a debt, would you have paid it? Pay Allah, for Allah is most deserving of payment."*
> — [Al-Bukhari (1852)]
