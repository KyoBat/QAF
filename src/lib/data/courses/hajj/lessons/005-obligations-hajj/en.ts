> The obligations of Hajj (wājibāt) constitute an intermediate level between the pillars (arkān) and the recommended acts (sunan). **Their omission does not invalidate Hajj but requires compensation through sacrifice** (dam).

## 📖 Foundational Text (النص التأسيسي)

### 🔷 The Verse of Completion

> **﴿ وَأَتِمُّوا الْحَجَّ وَالْعُمْرَةَ لِلَّهِ ﴾**
> *"And complete the Hajj and 'Umrah for Allah"*
> — [Al-Baqara: 196]

This divine command encompasses the performance of all Hajj acts: pillars, obligations, and recommendations. The completeness (itmam) implies not neglecting any of the prescribed rites.

### 🔷 The Hadith of Obligations

> عَنْ عَبْدِ الرَّحْمَنِ بْنِ يَعْمَرَ الدِّيلِيِّ قَالَ: شَهِدْتُ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ ﷺ وَهُوَ وَاقِفٌ بِعَرَفَةَ وَأَتَاهُ نَاسٌ مِنْ أَهْلِ نَجْدٍ فَقَالُوا: يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ، كَيْفَ الْحَجُّ؟ قَالَ: **« الْحَجُّ عَرَفَةُ، فَمَنْ جَاءَ قَبْلَ صَلَاةِ الْفَجْرِ مِنْ لَيْلَةِ جَمْعٍ فَقَدْ تَمَّ حَجُّهُ »**

From 'Abd ar-Rahman ibn Ya'mar ad-Dili: "I was present with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ while he was standing at 'Arafat. People from Najd came to him and asked: 'O Messenger of Allah, how is Hajj performed?' He replied: **'Hajj is 'Arafat. Whoever arrives before the Fajr prayer of the night of Jam' (Muzdalifa), his Hajj is complete.'**"

— [Reported by At-Tirmidhi (889), An-Nasa'i (3016), Abu Dawud (1949) — Authenticated]

This hadith distinguishes the essential pillar ('Arafat) from other obligatory or recommended acts.

## 📚 Detailed Explanation

### 1. Fundamental Difference: Pillar vs. Obligation

| Aspect | Pillar (Rukn) | Obligation (Wajib) |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Nature** | Constitutive element of Hajj | Required complementary act |
| **Omission** | **Invalidates Hajj** | Does not invalidate it |
| **Compensation** | Impossible — must be performed | Through sacrifice (dam) |
| **Replacement** | No replacement possible | Sacrifice or fasting |

### 2. The Six Obligations According to the Maliki Madhhab

#### 🟡 First Obligation: Ihram from the Miqat

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"These (Miqat) are for their inhabitants and for whoever passes through them from other places intending Hajj or 'Umrah"**
> — [Al-Bukhari (1526), Muslim (1181)]

| Situation | Ruling |
|-----------|--------|
| Ihram before the Miqat | Valid but makruh |
| Ihram at the Miqat | In accordance with Sunnah |
| Ihram after the Miqat | **Sacrifice required (dam)** |
| Returning to Miqat for Ihram | Cancels the dam obligation |

#### 🟡 Second Obligation: Staying at Muzdalifa

> **﴿ فَإِذَا أَفَضْتُم مِّنْ عَرَفَاتٍ فَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ عِندَ الْمَشْعَرِ الْحَرَامِ ﴾**
> *"Then when you depart from 'Arafat, remember Allah at al-Mash'ar al-Haram (Muzdalifa)"*
> — [Al-Baqara: 198]

This is the night of the 9th to 10th Dhul-Hijja, after departing from 'Arafat.

| Madhhab | Minimum Duration Required |
|---------|--------------------------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | **A stop, even brief (nuzul)** |
| 🟢 Hanafi | Presence at dawn (from Fajr to sunrise) |
| 🔵 Shafi'i | A moment after midnight |
| 🟣 Hanbali | The greater part of the night |

#### 🟡 Third Obligation: Staying at Mina

The nights of the days of Tashriq (11th, 12th, 13th Dhul-Hijja).

> The Prophet ﷺ **"granted a concession to Al-'Abbas ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib to spend the nights of Mina in Makkah due to his role of providing water (to pilgrims)"**
> — [Al-Bukhari (1745), Muslim (1315)]

This concession shows that staying overnight is an obligation, as legal concessions only apply to obligations.

#### 🟡 Fourth Obligation: Stoning the Jamarat (Ramy)

| Day | Pillars to Stone | Total Number |
|-----|------------------|--------------|
| 10th Dhul-Hijja (Yawm an-Nahr) | Al-'Aqaba only | 7 pebbles |
| 11th Dhul-Hijja | Small → Medium → Large | 21 pebbles |
| 12th Dhul-Hijja | Small → Medium → Large | 21 pebbles |
| 13th Dhul-Hijja (if not ta'ajjul) | Small → Medium → Large | 21 pebbles |

**Total: 70 pebbles** (or 49 in case of early departure on the 12th)

#### 🟡 Fifth Obligation: Shaving or Trimming

> The Prophet ﷺ supplicated: **"O Allah, forgive those who shave"** — three times. They said: "And those who trim?" He said: **"And those who trim"**
> — [Al-Bukhari (1727), Muslim (1301)]

| Category | Ruling |
|----------|--------|
| Men | Shaving (halq) preferred, trimming (taqsir) permitted |
| Women | Trimming only (fingertip length) |

#### 🟡 Sixth Obligation: The Farewell Tawaf (Tawaf al-Wada')

> The Prophet ﷺ said: **"Let no one depart until their last act is (visiting) the House"**
> — [Muslim (1327)]

**Exemptions:** Menstruating women and those in post-natal bleeding are exempt (hadith of Ibn 'Abbas).

## ⚖️ Differences Between Schools

| Obligation | 🟡 Maliki | 🟢 Hanafi | 🔵 Shafi'i | 🟣 Hanbali |
|------------|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Ihram at Miqat** | Wajib | Wajib | Wajib | Wajib |
| **Staying at Muzdalifa** | Wajib | Sunnah (presence at Fajr wajib) | Wajib | Wajib |
| **Staying at Mina** | Wajib | Sunnah | Wajib | Wajib |
| **Stoning** | Wajib | Wajib | Wajib | Wajib |
| **Halq/Taqsir** | Wajib | Wajib | **Rukn** | Wajib |
| **Tawaf al-Wada'** | Wajib | Wajib | Wajib | Wajib |

**Note:** For Shafi'is, Halq/Taqsir is a pillar (rukn) and not merely an obligation.

## 🌍 Modern Applications

### Crowd Management and Dispensations

| Contemporary Situation | Jurisprudential Solution |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Inability to stay at Mina** (lack of space) | Stay in authorized adjacent areas |
| **Impossibility of stoning during the day** | Scholars permit nighttime stoning based on need |
| **Delegation of stoning** | Permitted for the sick, elderly, and pregnant women |
| **Group shaving on Eid day** | Valid, the essential is that it is performed |

### Financial Compensation for Dam

The pilgrim who omits an obligation must:
1. **Sacrifice a sheep** in Makkah (preferably)
2. **Distribute the meat to the poor** of the Haram
3. **In case of financial inability**: fast 10 days (3 during Hajj + 7 upon return)

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| Believing that omitting a wajib invalidates Hajj | Hajj remains valid but incomplete — dam required |
| Neglecting the Farewell Tawaf due to forgetfulness | Return if possible, otherwise dam |
| Stoning before the prescribed time | Invalid — must be repeated within the time |
| Leaving Mina before sunset on the 12th to avoid the 13th | Permitted by the Quran [Al-Baqara: 203] |
| Thinking women must shave | They only trim |

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### 🌅 Case 1: Departure from Muzdalifa Before Fajr for Health Reasons

> **Situation:** Maryam, 68, suffers from heart problems. Her doctor advised her to avoid large crowds. Her group decides to leave Muzdalifa around 2 AM to avoid the rush.

**❓ Is her early departure permitted?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the Ruling</summary>

**📖 Analysis:**

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Required Mabit | Minimum presence required |
| Health excuse | Valid reason for early departure |
| Maliki position | A simple stop suffices (نزول) |

> 💡 **Key Rule:** According to Malikis, Mabit at Muzdalifa requires a **stop** even if brief. If she stopped even for a moment, the obligation is fulfilled. Early departure for health reasons is permitted without Dam.

</details>

---

### 🏠 Case 2: Night at Mina in Tent Outside Official Boundaries

> **Situation:** Hassan's group was housed in a tent located just outside the official boundaries of Mina due to lack of space. They spent the nights of the 11th, 12th, and 13th of Dhul-Hijja in this tent.

**❓ Does the Mabit count as valid?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the Ruling</summary>

**📖 Analysis:**

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Boundaries of Mina | Must be respected |
| Adjacent area | Tolerated in case of necessity |
| Contemporary fatwa | Overflow permitted by necessity |

> 💡 **Key Rule:** Contemporary scholars have permitted staying in **adjacent areas** when Mina is full. If the camp was assigned by Hajj authorities and there was no alternative, the Mabit is valid without Dam.

</details>

### 🪨 Case 3: Missed Stoning One Day — Making Up the Next Day

> **Situation:** Bilal was very sick on the 11th of Dhul-Hijja and couldn't stone the three Jamarat. On the 12th, he feels better and wants to make up.

**❓ Can he make up the stoning of the 11th on the 12th?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the Ruling</summary>

**📖 Analysis:**

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Order of days | Must be respected |
| Making up | Possible the following day |
| Method | First those of the 11th, then those of the 12th |

> 💡 **Key Rule:** He can make up the stoning of the 11th on the 12th, **before** doing that of the 12th. The order must be respected: the three Jamarat of the 11th, then the three Jamarat of the 12th. If making up is impossible, a Dam is due.

### ✂️ Case 4: Shaving Head Done Before Stoning (Reversed Order)

> **Situation:** Ahmed, in the confusion of Eid day, had his head shaved before stoning Jamarat al-'Aqaba. He only realized his error afterward.

**❓ Is there a consequence for this reversed order?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the Ruling</summary>

**📖 Analysis:**

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Sunnah order on day 10 | Stoning → Sacrifice → Shaving → Tawaf |
| Maliki position | Order is recommended, not obligatory |
| Reversal | No Dam, but contrary to Sunnah |

> 💡 **Key Rule:** According to Malikis, the order of acts on the 10th is **recommended** (mustahabb) but not obligatory. The reversal does **not require Dam**. The Hajj remains valid, but he missed the optimal order.

</details>

### 🚶 Case 5: Leaving Makkah Without Farewell Tawaf — Medical Emergency

> **Situation:** Fatou learns that her father is seriously ill in her country. She must take an emergency flight and doesn't have time for Tawaf al-Wadaa before leaving.

**❓ Does she owe a Dam for omitting the Farewell Tawaf?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the Ruling</summary>

**📖 Analysis:**

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Tawaf al-Wadaa | Obligation (Wajib) |
| Valid excuse | Family medical emergency |
| Basic rule | Omission = Dam |

> 💡 **Key Rule:** The Farewell Tawaf is an **obligation**. Its omission without excuse requires a Dam. However, scholars differ on medical emergencies. The cautious position is to offer a Dam as a precaution, but some scholars excuse genuine emergencies. She should consult a scholar and, if possible, send someone to sacrifice on her behalf in Makkah.

## 💭 Reflection

> *"The obligations of Hajj are the ornaments of the journey. Without them, Hajj is like a body without beauty. Their omission is repairable, but their performance is the path of excellence."*

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: What if I omitted an obligation out of ignorance?**
> Ignorance does not cancel the obligation of dam. However, no sin is incurred if the omission was unintentional.

**Q2: Can multiple dam be combined for multiple omissions?**
> According to the majority, each omitted obligation requires its own dam. Some Hanafis permit a single dam for omissions of the same type.

**Q3: Does Tawaf al-Wada' apply to Makkah residents?**
> 🟡 According to Malikis, no. Other schools require it even for Makkans.

**Q4: What if I cannot afford to sacrifice?**
> Fast 10 days: 3 during Hajj and 7 after returning home.

## ✅ Practical Action / Challenge

**Before your Hajj:**
1. **Memorize** the list of 6 Maliki obligations and their chronological order
2. **Prepare** a budget for a potential dam (approximately $100-150 currently)
3. **Identify** situations where delegation is permitted (stoning for vulnerable individuals)
