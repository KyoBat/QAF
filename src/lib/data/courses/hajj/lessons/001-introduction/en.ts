## Introduction

The pilgrimage to the Sacred House (Al-Hajj) is the fifth pillar of Islam. It is a unique spiritual journey that brings together millions of Muslims from around the world in the worship of Allah تعالى.

> **﴿ And [due] to Allah from the people is a pilgrimage to the House - for whoever is able to find thereto a way. But whoever disbelieves - then indeed, Allah is free from need of the worlds. ﴾**
> [Âl-Imrân: 97]

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **"Islam is built upon five pillars: testifying that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger, establishing prayer, giving Zakat, fasting Ramadan, and making pilgrimage to the House for whoever is able to find a way."**
> — [Muslim (8)]

## 1. Definition of Hajj

### 1.1 Linguistic Definition (اللغوية)

The word **الحَجّ** (Al-Hajj) linguistically means: **intending to go toward something venerated** (القصد إلى معظَّم).

Arabs would say: "حَجَّ فُلانٌ فُلانًا" (someone made hajj to someone) meaning he went toward him with respect.

### 1.2 Legal Definition (الشرعية)

Hajj according to Sharia is defined as:

> **"Going to the Sacred House of Allah to perform specific rites at a specific time."**

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **قَصْدُ** | Intention and traveling |
| **بَيْتِ اللهِ الحَرَامِ** | The Ka'bah in Makkah |
| **مَنَاسِكَ مَخْصُوصَةٍ** | Ihram, Tawaf, Sa'i, Standing at Arafat... |
| **وَقْتٍ مَخْصُوصٍ** | The months of Hajj (Shawwal, Dhul-Qi'dah, Dhul-Hijjah) |

## 2. Umrah (العمرة)

### 2.1 Definition

Umrah is the **lesser pilgrimage**. It is defined as:

> **"Visiting the Sacred House of Allah to perform Tawaf and Sa'i in a state of Ihram."**

### 2.2 Difference Between Hajj and Umrah

## 5. History of Hajj

### 📌 Construction of the Ka'bah

Ibrahim عليه السلام and his son Isma'il عليه السلام built the Ka'bah by Allah's command:

> **﴿ And [mention] when Ibrahim was raising the foundations of the House and [with him] Isma'il, [saying], "Our Lord, accept [this] from us. Indeed, You are the Hearing, the Knowing." ﴾**
> [Al-Baqarah: 127]

### 📌 The Call to Pilgrimage

After the construction, Allah commanded Ibrahim to call people to pilgrimage:

> **﴿ And proclaim to the people the Hajj ﴾**

Ibn Abbas رضي الله عنهما reported: "Ibrahim stood on his rock and called out: 'O people! Your Lord has built a House, so make pilgrimage to it!'"

### 📌 The Prophet's ﷺ Hajj

The Prophet ﷺ performed only **one Hajj** in his lifetime: the **Farewell Pilgrimage** (حجة الوداع) in the 10th year of Hijrah, a few months before his death.

This Hajj is the reference for all rites, as the Prophet ﷺ said:

> **"Take your rites from me."**
> — [Muslim (1297)]

## 6. Obligation Once in a Lifetime

### 📌 A One-Time Obligation

Hajj is only obligatory **once in a lifetime** for those who have the ability.

> Abu Hurayrah رضي الله عنه reported that the Prophet ﷺ said: **"O people! Allah has prescribed Hajj for you, so perform it."** A man asked: "Every year, O Messenger of Allah?" He remained silent until the man repeated it three times. Then the Prophet ﷺ said: **"If I had said yes, it would have become obligatory, and you would not have been able to do it."**
> — [Muslim (1337)]

### 📌 Any Additional Hajj is Voluntary

After the first obligatory Hajj, any additional Hajj is **Nafl** (voluntary) and brings immense reward.
