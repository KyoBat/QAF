## 📖 Foundational Text (النص التأسيسي)

### 🔷 The Verse of Obligation

> **﴿ وَلِلَّهِ عَلَى النَّاسِ حِجُّ الْبَيْتِ مَنِ اسْتَطَاعَ إِلَيْهِ سَبِيلًا ۚ وَمَن كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَنِيٌّ عَنِ الْعَالَمِينَ ﴾**
>
> *"And [due] to Allah from the people is a pilgrimage to the House - for whoever is able to find thereto a way. But whoever disbelieves - then indeed, Allah is free from need of the worlds."* [Âl-Imrân: 97]

### 🔷 The Hadith of the Pillars

On the authority of Abdullah ibn Umar رضي الله عنهما who said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:

**« بُنِيَ الإِسْلاَمُ عَلَى خَمْسٍ: شَهَادَةِ أَنْ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ اللَّهِ، وَإِقَامِ الصَّلاَةِ، وَإِيتَاءِ الزَّكَاةِ، وَصَوْمِ رَمَضَانَ، وَحَجِّ الْبَيْتِ مَنِ اسْتَطَاعَ إِلَيْهِ سَبِيلاً »**

*"Islam is built upon five [pillars]: the testimony that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, establishing prayer, giving Zakat, fasting Ramadan, and pilgrimage to the House for whoever is able to find a way."*

## 📚 Detailed Explanation (الشرح المفصل)

### 1️⃣ Definition of Hajj

#### Linguistic and Technical Definition

| Aspect | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **Linguistically** | **القَصْدُ إلى مُعَظَّم** — Intending toward something venerated |
| **Technically** | **قَصْدُ بَيْتِ اللهِ الحَرَامِ لأَدَاءِ مَنَاسِكَ مَخْصُوصَةٍ فِي وَقْتٍ مَخْصُوصٍ** — Going to the Sacred House of Allah to perform specific rites at a specific time |

#### Breakdown of the Definition

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **قَصْدُ** | Firm intention and physical travel |
| **بَيْتِ اللهِ الحَرَامِ** | The Ka'bah in Makkah and its surroundings |
| **مَنَاسِكَ مَخْصُوصَةٍ** | Ihram, Tawaf, Sa'i, Standing at Arafat, etc. |
| **وَقْتٍ مَخْصُوصٍ** | The months of Hajj: Shawwal, Dhul-Qi'dah, first 10 days of Dhul-Hijjah |

>
> *"Visiting the Sacred House of Allah to perform Tawaf and Sa'i in a state of Ihram."*

| Aspect | Hajj | Umrah |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Status** | 5th Pillar — Fard 'Ayn | Sunnah Mu'akkadah (🟡 Maliki) |

## 🕌 Opinions of the Madhahib (آراء المذاهب)

### ⚠️ Difference on the Status of Umrah

| School | Opinion | Evidence |
|--------|---------|----------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | **Sunnah Mu'akkadah** | The verse only mentions Hajj as obligation |
| 🟢 **Hanafi** | Sunnah Mu'akkadah | Same reasoning as Malikis |
| 🔵 **Shafi'i** | **Obligatory once** | Hadith: « الحَجُّ وَالعُمْرَةُ فَرِيضَتَانِ » |
| 🟣 **Hanbali** | Obligatory once | Same view as Shafi'is |

> 💡 **Maliki Position:** Umrah is **strongly recommended** but not obligatory. The verse of Âl-Imrân only mentions Hajj, and the hadith on the obligation of Umrah is considered weak by the Malikis.

### ⚠️ Difference on the Immediacy of Hajj

Does Hajj become obligatory **immediately** when conditions are met, or can it be **delayed**?

| School | Opinion | Evidence |
|--------|---------|----------|
| 🟡 **Maliki** | **Immediately (الفور)** | Delay without excuse is sinful |
| 🟢 **Hanafi** | Delayed (التراخي) | May delay as long as possible |
| 🔵 **Shafi'i** | Delayed | One's lifetime is the time |
| 🟣 **Hanbali** | Immediately | Hadith: « فَلْيَتَعَجَّلْ » (let him hasten) |

> 💡 **Maliki Position:** Once capable, one **must perform Hajj** without unjustified delay. Delaying without a valid excuse is a **sin** (معصية).

**❓ Is Hajj immediately obligatory for him?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the Ruling</summary>

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Istita'a (capability) | Not currently fulfilled |

**❓ What is his legal situation?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the Ruling</summary>

**📖 Analysis:**

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Delay without excuse | Sinful according to Malikis |
| Current incapacity | Must delegate someone |
| Repentance | Required for years of delay |

> 💡 **Key Rule:** According to the Maliki position, Hajj is obligatory **immediately** upon capability. If he can no longer travel, he must pay for someone else to perform it on his behalf.

</details>

### 💸 Case 3: Savings vs. Student Debt

> **Situation:** Youssef, 28, has saved €4000. He also has €15000 in student debt with regular monthly payments. Should he perform Hajj or pay off his debt first?

**❓ Can he use his savings for Hajj?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the Ruling</summary>

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Type of debt | Deferred (installments) |
| Maliki position | Deferred debt doesn't prevent Hajj |

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### "Can I delay Hajj if I have the money?"

**Maliki Answer:** No, once conditions are met (money, health, safety), Hajj becomes obligatory **immediately**. Delaying without a valid excuse is sinful.

### "Does Umrah replace Hajj?"

**No.** They are two distinct acts of worship. Umrah does not erase the obligation of Hajj.

### "How many times is Hajj obligatory?"

**Once** in a lifetime. Any additional Hajj is supererogatory (Nafl) and brings great reward.

### "Should I go into debt for Hajj?"

**No.** Financial capability (الاستطاعة) is a condition. Going into debt is not recommended for Hajj.

### "What is Hajj Mabrour?"

It is the Hajj **accepted by Allah**: performed with sincerity, without obscenity (رَفَث) or transgression (فُسُوق), and which transforms the pilgrim positively.
