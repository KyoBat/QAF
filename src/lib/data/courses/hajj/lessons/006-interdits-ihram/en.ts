### 🔷 The Hadith of Clothing

> عَنِ ابْنِ عُمَرَ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمَا أَنَّ رَجُلًا سَأَلَ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ ﷺ: مَا يَلْبَسُ الْمُحْرِمُ؟ فَقَالَ: **« لاَ يَلْبَسُ الْقَمِيصَ وَلاَ الْعَمَائِمَ وَلاَ السَّرَاوِيلاَتِ وَلاَ الْبَرَانِسَ وَلاَ الْخِفَافَ، إِلَّا أَنْ لاَ يَجِدَ نَعْلَيْنِ فَلْيَلْبَسِ الْخُفَّيْنِ، وَلْيَقْطَعْهُمَا حَتَّى يَكُونَا أَسْفَلَ مِنَ الْكَعْبَيْنِ. وَلاَ يَلْبَسْ مِنَ الثِّيَابِ شَيْئًا مَسَّهُ زَعْفَرَانٌ أَوْ الْوَرْسُ »**

From Ibn 'Umar رضي الله عنهما, a man asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ: "What may the muhrim (one in Ihram) wear?" He replied: **"He does not wear a shirt, turban, trousers, hooded cloak, or leather socks (khuff) — unless he cannot find sandals, then he may wear khuff cut below the ankles. And he should not wear any garment touched by saffron or wars (a dye plant)."**

— [Al-Bukhari (1542), Muslim (1177)]
