## 📖 Foundational Text (النص التأسيسي)

### 🔷 The Hadith of Arafat

Narrated by 'Abd Ar-Rahman ibn Ya'mur Ad-Dili رضي الله عنه that the Prophet ﷺ said:

**« الحَجُّ عَرَفَةُ، فَمَنْ أَدْرَكَ لَيْلَةَ عَرَفَةَ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ الْفَجْرِ مِنْ لَيْلَةِ جَمْعٍ فَقَدْ تَمَّ حَجُّهُ »**

*"Hajj is Arafat. Whoever reaches Arafat before dawn of the night of Muzdalifa, their Hajj is complete."*

### 🔷 The Verse of Tawaf

> **﴿ ثُمَّ لْيَقْضُوا تَفَثَهُمْ وَلْيُوفُوا نُذُورَهُمْ وَلْيَطَّوَّفُوا بِالْبَيْتِ الْعَتِيقِ ﴾**
>
> *"Then let them end their untidiness, fulfill their vows, and perform Tawaf around the Ancient House."* [Al-Hajj: 29]

### 📐 Hadith Analysis

| Segment | Analysis |
|---------|----------|
| **الحَجُّ عَرَفَةُ** | Nominal sentence — subject and predicate |
| **عَرَفَةُ** | Predicate in nominative (Hajj = Arafat) |
| **مَنْ أَدْرَكَ** | Conditional pronoun (whoever reaches) |
| **فَقَدْ تَمَّ** | Conditional response (then it is complete) |

### 💡 Rhetorical Point

The expression **"الحَجُّ عَرَفَةُ"** is a **metonymy** (مجاز مرسل): the entire Hajj is identified with just one of its pillars, showing the **paramount importance** of Wuquf. It's like saying "prayer is prostration" — highlighting the noblest element.
