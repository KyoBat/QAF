export const content = `# Arafat, Muzdalifa and Mina: The Essential Stages of Hajj (عرفة ومزدلفة ومنى)

## Introduction

These three sacred locations constitute the very heart of the pilgrimage. Arafat, Muzdalifa, and Mina form a spiritual journey that every pilgrim must accomplish in a specific order and at determined times. The Wuquf at Arafat is the very essence of Hajj, the night at Muzdalifa is a major obligation, and the stay at Mina with its stoning rites crowns this spiritual journey. Understanding these stages is essential to perform a valid and accepted Hajj.

## 1. 📜 Foundational Texts (النصوص الأساسية)

## 2. 🗣️ Scholarly Opinions (أقوال العلماء)

> **Imam Malik (رحمه الله)** said:
> "Whoever misses Arafat has missed the Hajj. And whoever arrives at Arafat at night, before the dawn of the Day of Sacrifice, even for an instant, has attained the Hajj."
> — [Al-Mudawwana, 1/423]

> **Imam Ibn Rushd (رحمه الله)** explained:
> "The scholars are unanimous that the Wuquf at Arafat is the most important pillar of Hajj, because the Prophet ﷺ said: 'Hajj is Arafat.' And they differ on the status of the night at Muzdalifa and the stoning of the pillars."
> — [Bidayat al-Mujtahid, 2/107]

> **Imam an-Nawawi (رحمه الله)** said:
> "The standing at Arafat begins after the zenith of the 9th day and extends until the dawn of the 10th. It is obligatory to stay until sunset according to our school, and it is a recommendation according to others."
> — [Al-Majmu', 8/100]

> **Ibn al-Qayyim (رحمه الله)** wrote:
> "Muzdalifa is called 'al-Mash'ar al-Haram' (the Sacred Monument), and 'Jam'' because pilgrims gather there, and 'Muzdalifa' because one draws near to Allah after departing from Arafat."
> — [Zad al-Ma'ad, 2/254]

## 8. ❓ FAQ (الأسئلة الشائعة)

**Q1: What should I do if I arrive at Arafat after sunset on the 9th?**
> As long as you arrive before the dawn of the 10th, your Hajj is valid. The Prophet ﷺ said: "Whoever arrives before dawn has attained the Hajj."

**Q2: Can I sleep the whole time at Arafat without making supplications?**
> Your Wuquf is valid, but you lose an immense reward. It is the best day for supplications.

**Q3: Can I delegate someone to stone on my behalf if I am tired?**
> Fatigue alone does not justify delegation. There must be real incapacity (illness, inability to walk, etc.).

**Q4: What happens if I miss the night at Muzdalifa?**
> According to the Malikis and the majority, you owe a dam (sacrifice). But if you had a valid excuse, nothing is owed.

**Q5: Can I stone after Maghrib on the Tashriq days?**
> Yes, the stoning time extends until the dawn of the following day, but after sunset is makruh (disliked) except for necessity.

**Q6: If I am in a hurry, can I leave Mina on the 12th day?**
> Yes, but you must leave before sunset. If the sun sets while you are at Mina, you must stay for the stoning of the 13th.
