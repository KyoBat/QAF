## 📖 Stories from the Salaf: Ibn Mas'ûd and Group Dhikr

'Abdullâh ibn Mas'ûd رضي الله عنه entered the mosque and found people sitting in circles, each one holding pebbles, and a man saying: "Say SubhânAllah one hundred times, say Allâhu Akbar one hundred times, say Lâ ilâha illa Allâh one hundred times."

Ibn Mas'ûd said: **"What is this I see you doing?"**

They said: O Abû 'Abd ar-Rahmân, pebbles by which we count the takbîr, tahlîl, and tasbîh.

He said: **"Then count your sins, for I guarantee that none of your good deeds will be lost! Woe to you, O Ummah of Muhammad! How quickly you rush to destruction! These are his Companions ﷺ still abundant, these are his clothes not yet worn out, and his vessels not yet broken. By Him in Whose Hand is my soul, you are either upon a way more guided than Muhammad's way, or you are opening a door of misguidance!"**

They said: By Allah, O Abû 'Abd ar-Rahmân, we only intended good!

He said: **"How many who intend good never achieve it."**

**Lesson learned**: Good intention doesn't validate an act if it's not upon the Prophet's ﷺ guidance.

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### Case 1: Praying Tarâwîh Behind the TV

**Sa'îd** can't go to the mosque, so he prays at home behind the imam he watches on TV.

**Question**: Is this permissible?

**Answer**:
- ❌ **Praying behind the TV is invalid** — due to discontinuity of rows
- ✅ **Alternative**: Pray alone or with his family
- ⚠️ This isn't innovation, but a juristic error

---

### Case 2: Group Supplication After Every Prayer

**In the local mosque**, after every prayer the mu'adhdhin raises his hands and says: "O Allah..." and the worshippers say Âmîn.

**Question**: Is this Sunnah or innovation?

**Answer**:
- ❌ **Constant group supplication after every prayer = innovation**
- ✅ **The Sunnah**: Individual dhikr after prayer
- ✅ **What's permissible**: Group supplication sometimes for a reason (seeking rain, calamity)

---

### Case 3: Reciting Al-Fâtihah for the Deceased

**At condolences**, people gather to recite Al-Fâtihah for the deceased's soul.

**Question**: What's the ruling?

**Answer**:
- ⚠️ **Reciting Quran for the deceased**: Scholars differed about it
- ❌ **Gathering for it in this manner**: The Salaf didn't do it
- ✅ **Better**: Supplicating for the deceased and giving charity on their behalf

---

### Case 4: The Night of Mid-Sha'bân

**Village people** gather on the night of mid-Sha'bân for prayer, supplication, and group dhikr.

**Question**: What's the ruling?

**Answer**:
- ✅ **Praying the night individually**: Recommended every night
- ❌ **Specifying mid-Sha'bân night with gathering**: Innovation
- ⚠️ The hadiths about its virtue are weak or fabricated

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

**Personal question**: 

How can you distinguish between Sunnah and innovation in acts of worship?

**The criterion**:
1. Is there evidence from Quran, Sunnah, or the Companions' practice?
2. Did the Salaf do it this way?
3. Is it worship or means?

Remember: The safest path is following the Prophet ﷺ and his Companions. They practiced the best, most complete religion.
