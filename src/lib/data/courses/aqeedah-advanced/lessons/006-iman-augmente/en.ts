## 📖 Stories from the Salaf: Hanzalah and Abû Bakr on Faith's Fluctuation

**In Madinah**, Hanzalah al-Usayyidî رضي الله عنه came to Abû Bakr as-Siddîq رضي الله عنه distressed...

Hanzalah said: **"Hanzalah has become a hypocrite, O Abû Bakr!"**

Abû Bakr said: SubhânAllah! What are you saying?!

Hanzalah said: **"When we are with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, he reminds us of the Fire and Paradise as if we see them with our own eyes. But when we leave the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, we engage with wives, children, and livelihood, and we forget much!"**

Abû Bakr said: **"By Allah, we experience the same thing!"**

So they went to the Prophet ﷺ, and Hanzalah told him what he said...

The Prophet ﷺ said: **"By Him in Whose Hand is my soul, if you remained in the state you are in when with me, and in remembrance, the angels would shake hands with you in your beds and on your paths. But O Hanzalah, there is a time and a time."** [Muslim]

**Lesson learned**: Even the Companions felt fluctuations in faith! This is natural. The important thing is to renew your faith and not surrender to heedlessness.
