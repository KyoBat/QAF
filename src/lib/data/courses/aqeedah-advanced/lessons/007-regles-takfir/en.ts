## 📖 Stories from the Salaf: Imam Ahmad's Caution in Takfir

A man came to **Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal** رحمه الله and said:

"O Imam! So-and-so says the Quran is created. Should we declare him a disbeliever?"

Imam Ahmad said: **"Saying the Quran is created is disbelief. As for so-and-so specifically, I don't declare him a disbeliever until proof is established upon him."**

And he رحمه الله used to say: **"I don't declare anyone from the people of the Qiblah a disbeliever."**

Even though Al-Ma'mûn and Al-Mu'tasim imprisoned him, beat him, and nearly killed him because of their saying that the Quran was created!

**Lesson learned**: See the caution of this Imam! He didn't let the injustice done to him push him to rush into takfir. He distinguished between judging the statement and judging the speaker.

## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### Case 1: A Youth Insulting Religion on Social Media

**Omar** sees posts on Twitter by a youth insulting Islam and mocking the Prophet ﷺ.

**Question**: Should we judge him as a disbeliever?

**Answer**: 
- ❌ **The act itself**: Insulting the religion and Prophet is major disbelief by consensus
- ⚠️ **Judging the specific person**: Requires verifying conditions and absence of impediments
- ✅ **What we must do**: Disassociate from this act and advise if possible
- ❌ **What we shouldn't do**: Issue individual takfir judgments

---

### Case 2: One Who Abandons Prayer Due to Laziness

**Khalid** is a young Muslim but hasn't prayed for years. He says: "I'm a believer but lazy."

**Question**: Has he disbelieved?

**Answer**:
- ⚠️ **Scholarly difference**: This is a disputed issue among scholars
- ❌ **Majority of Salaf's view**: One who completely abandons prayer is a disbeliever
- ⚠️ **Some scholars' view**: He's not a disbeliever but in great danger
- ✅ **Our duty**: Advise him and warn him of Allah, not issue a takfir ruling

---

### Case 3: One Who Permits Bank Interest

**Ahmad** says: "The prohibited interest is only pre-Islamic usury. As for today's bank interest, it's permissible!"

**Question**: What's the ruling on his statement and on him?

**Answer**:
- ❌ **Permitting what there's consensus on forbidding**: Disbelief if with knowledge and stubbornness
- ⚠️ **But Ahmad might be**: Making a wrong interpretation, or ignorant, or following a fatwa he heard
- ✅ **Our duty**: Clarify the truth to him with evidence, not rush to declare him a disbeliever

---

### Case 4: One Who Rules by Man-Made Laws

**A ruler** in a Muslim country rules by laws contrary to Sharî'ah.

**Question**: Has he disbelieved?

**Answer**:
- ❌ **Whoever replaced the Sharî'ah and considers it permissible**: Has disbelieved
- ⚠️ **Whoever rules by other than Allah's law believing it's forbidden**: Minor disbelief according to most
- ⚠️ **Takfir of specific individual**: Only after establishing proof and knowing his situation

> Ibn 'Abbâs said regarding ﴿وَمَن لَّمْ يَحْكُم بِمَا أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ﴾: **"Disbelief less than disbelief"**

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

**Personal question**: 

Why were the Salaf cautious about takfir, while today we see some rushing into it?

Reflect on these reasons:
1. **Ignorance** of takfir's rules and conditions
2. **Uncontrolled zeal** without knowledge
3. **Arrogance** and desire for prominence
4. **Following desires** and not scholars

Remember: Takfir without right is among the most dangerous matters. The Prophet ﷺ warned us severely about it!

### Q2: Who implements the ruling of Takfir?

**Answer**: **Islamic judiciary** only; individuals have no right to act based on Takfir.

### Q3: What's the difference between the Khawârij and Ahl as-Sunnah in Takfir?
