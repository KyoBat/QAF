## 🎯 Contemporary Cases

### 🌐 Case 1: Insults on Social Media

> **Situation:** Ahmed, 19, in a moment of anger on social media, wrote insults against Allah after reading a provocative comment. He immediately realized his mistake.

**❓ Has he left Islam because of this post?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the answer</summary>

**📖 Analysis:**

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **The act itself** | Insulting Allah is a major nullifier |
| **Extreme anger** | Can be an impediment if total loss of control |
| **Immediate regret** | Sign that the heart rejects the act |
| **Solution** | Sincere repentance, Shahada, and delete the post |

> 💡 **Rule:** Extreme anger that causes loss of reason is an impediment to Takfir, but repentance and renewal of faith remain obligatory.

### 🕌 Case 2: Mocking the Worshippers

> **Situation:** At a family gathering, Karim mocked his praying cousin saying: "You're wasting your time with these outdated rituals."

**❓ Is mocking the prayer a nullifier?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the answer</summary>

**📖 Analysis:**

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Target of mockery** | The Salat itself (pillar of Islam) |
| **Key difference** | Mocking religion ≠ mocking the person |
| **Verse** | ﴿ قُلْ أَبِاللَّهِ وَآيَاتِهِ وَرَسُولِهِ كُنتُمْ تَسْتَهْزِئُونَ ﴾ |

> 💡 **Rule:** Mocking religion, its rites or its symbols is a nullifier of Islam. Mocking a person for something else (their appearance, etc.) is forbidden but not a nullifier.

</details>

### ⚖️ Case 3: Preferring Civil Laws

> **Situation:** Salim, a lawyer, publicly declares: "Western laws are more just than Sharia because they better protect women's rights."

**❓ Is this declaration a nullifier?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the answer</summary>

**📖 Analysis:**

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Content** | Preferring human legislation over Allah's |
| **Intention** | Does he truly believe human law is superior? |
| **Context** | Ignorance vs clear conviction |
| **Solution** | Clarification and teaching before judgment |

> 💡 **Rule:** Sincerely believing that human legislation is better than Allah's is a nullifier. But we must verify if it's ignorance, poor wording, or genuine conviction.

</details>

### 📿 Case 4: Wearing Amulets "for Baraka"

> **Situation:** Fatima wears a pendant with Quranic verses "to protect from the evil eye," believing that the object itself has protective power.

**❓ Is this shirk that nullifies Islam?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the answer</summary>

**📖 Analysis:**

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Belief in the object** | Does she believe it protects independently of Allah? |
| **Difference** | Legitimate cause vs invented cause |
| **Fatima's case** | Probably minor shirk (ignorance) |
| **If believing in inherent power** | Could become major shirk |

> 💡 **Rule:** Wearing amulets is at minimum forbidden. If the person believes the object protects by itself (without Allah), it's major shirk. If they believe it's a blessed cause, it's minor shirk.

### 🎭 Case 5: Playing a Blasphemous Role

> **Situation:** Omar, a Muslim actor, accepts a role in a film where his character pronounces words of disbelief and prostrates to an idol.

**❓ Is he a disbeliever for playing this role?**

<details>
<summary>📜 View the answer</summary>

**📖 Analysis:**

| Criterion | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Physical act** | Pronouncing kufr, prostrating to other than Allah |
| **Intention** | Playing a fictional character |
| **Scholars' view** | Act is forbidden even if "fiction" |
| **Judgment on person** | Requires study of Takfir conditions |

> 💡 **Rule:** Words and acts of disbelief are forbidden even when playing a role. However, judging the actor as a disbeliever requires verifying the conditions of Takfir. The act remains haram in all cases.
