## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Did the four Imams differ in creed?

**Answer**: No, they are unanimous in the foundations of belief. Their juristic differences don't touch creed.

### Q2: What is their position on Ash'arites and Mâturîdites?

**Answer**: These schools came after them. The four Imams are on the path of the Salaf in affirming Attributes.

### Q3: Why are some Ash'arites attributed to Ash-Shâfi'î and Mâlik?

**Answer**: This is a historical error. Al-Ash'arî himself returned to the Salaf's path at the end of his life.
