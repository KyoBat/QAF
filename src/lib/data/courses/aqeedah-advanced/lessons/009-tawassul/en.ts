## 🔍 Misconceptions and Responses

### Misconception: The blind man's hadith

| Misconception | Response |
|---------------|----------|
| "O Allah, I ask You and turn to You by Your Prophet" | This is Tawassul through the Prophet's ﷺ supplication while alive |
| Used for Tawassul through status | The hadith indicates Tawassul through supplication, not the person |

### Misconception: 'Umar's Tawassul through Al-'Abbâs

| Misconception | Response |
|---------------|----------|
| Tawassul through Al-'Abbâs, not his supplication | Rather through his supplication: "We used to make Tawassul through Your Prophet and You gave us rain" i.e. through his supplication |
| If it were through the person, they would have made Tawassul through the Prophet ﷺ | They turned to Al-'Abbâs because he's alive and can supplicate |

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf: 'Umar's Tawassul Through Al-'Abbâs

When drought struck the people during 'Umar ibn al-Khattâb's رضي الله عنه caliphate, he went out with the people to pray for rain.

'Umar said: **"O Allah, we used to make Tawassul to You through our Prophet and You would give us rain, and now we make Tawassul to You through our Prophet's uncle, so give us rain."**

Then he said to Al-'Abbâs: **"Stand and supplicate to Allah."**

So Al-'Abbâs stood and supplicated, and they were given rain.

**The great lesson**:
- If Tawassul through the Prophet's ﷺ person or status were permissible, they wouldn't have turned away from him to Al-'Abbâs!
- Rather, they made Tawassul **through Al-'Abbâs's supplication** because he was alive and could supplicate.

## 📖 Stories from the Salaf: The Companions of the Cave

Three men took shelter in a cave for the night when a boulder rolled down and blocked the entrance.

One of them said: **"Nothing will save you except that you supplicate to Allah through your righteous deeds."**

- The first made Tawassul through his dutifulness to his parents
- The second made Tawassul through his chastity from fornication
- The third made Tawassul through his honesty in returning wages

With each supplication, the boulder moved a third until they came out.

**The lesson**: This is legitimate Tawassul — through righteous deeds, not through the persons of created beings.

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

**Personal question**: 

Why do some people turn to the dead and saints instead of calling upon Allah directly?

**Reflect on the reasons**:
1. Ignorance of the correct understanding of Tawhîd
2. Feeling far from Allah and needing an intermediary
3. Following parents and society without thought
4. Exaggeration in loving the righteous

**The solution**: Know that Allah is close, hears supplication, and doesn't need intermediaries!

﴿ وَإِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِي عَنِّي فَإِنِّي قَرِيبٌ أُجِيبُ دَعْوَةَ الدَّاعِ إِذَا دَعَانِ ﴾
