## 🔍 Misconceptions and Responses

### Misconception: The blind man's hadith

| Misconception | Response |
|---------------|----------|
| "O Allah, I ask You and turn to You by Your Prophet" | This is Tawassul through the Prophet's ﷺ supplication while alive |
| Used for Tawassul through status | The hadith indicates Tawassul through supplication, not the person |

### Misconception: 'Umar's Tawassul through Al-'Abbâs

| Misconception | Response |
|---------------|----------|
| Tawassul through Al-'Abbâs, not his supplication | Rather through his supplication: "We used to make Tawassul through Your Prophet and You gave us rain" i.e. through his supplication |
| If it were through the person, they would have made Tawassul through the Prophet ﷺ | They turned to Al-'Abbâs because he's alive and can supplicate |
