## 📖 Stories from the Salaf: Abû Bakr and His Son at Badr

At the Battle of Badr, **'Abd ar-Rahmân ibn Abî Bakr** was still a disbeliever and went out with the polytheists to fight the Muslims.

During the battle, 'Abd ar-Rahmân was searching for his father **Abû Bakr as-Siddîq** رضي الله عنه to duel and kill him!

After 'Abd ar-Rahmân accepted Islam, he told his father: **"O father! I saw you at Badr but turned away from you and didn't kill you."**

Abû Bakr رضي الله عنه replied: **"As for me, had I seen you, I would have killed you!"**

**Lesson learned**: This is true alliance and disavowal — love for Allah and His Messenger above all else, even if the other party is among your closest relatives. But see how 'Abd ar-Rahmân later accepted Islam and became one of the best Companions!

## 💡 Pause and Reflect

**Personal question**: 

In the age of the internet and globalization, interacting with non-Muslims has become very easy.

**How do you balance:**
- The duty of calling to Allah
- Good character with everyone
- Preserving your Islamic identity
- Not dissolving into their culture?

Remember: The Prophet ﷺ had the best character with everyone, yet he never compromised an atom of his religion!
